abstract: 'Two-sided platforms are gaining increasing attention in practice and as
  the subject of IS and management research. We explore an assumption of research
  and practice: that a platform’s architecture needs to be decoupled so that producers
  can easily mix and match the platform’s design elements (APIs, code libraries, process
  models, etc.) into apps that perform well competitively, and insulate the platform
  from skewed outcomes and low market performance. However, in practice, complete
  decoupling is not just difficult but almost impossible. Based on more than two million
  runs of an exploratory NK model in which producers use a platform’s design space
  for the creation of apps, we generate several surprising insights. First, we show
  that tighter coupling may not necessarily be harmful depending on the producers’
  design strategies and the amount of constraints placed on design elements. Second,
  we observe that if moderate to tightly coupled platforms with optimizing producers
  focused exclusively on being competitive, platform performance is lower compared
  to platforms with satisficing producers who put a lower priority of being competitive
  because of other interests. This is surprising since optimizers are better suited
  to cope with the inherent uncertainty of coupling. Finally, moderately coupled platforms
  can outperform platforms with loose coupling when constraints nudge producers into
  distant design moves while also isolating them from downside uncertainty. These
  three findings offer implications for multiple streams of literature on platform
  architectures.'
