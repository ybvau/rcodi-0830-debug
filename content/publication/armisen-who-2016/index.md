abstract: 'Digital technologies have transformed how firms and individuals collaborate
  while giving rise to the phenomenon of open collaboration. Open collaboration, which
  originated in open source software, has spread beyond software. Open collaboration
  communities usually have three types of actors who collaborate by selectively revealing
  problems and solutions. These actors, that propose problems and solution to the
  community, are: 1) independent users, 2) firm users, and 3) firm producers. The
  proposed problems can be either path dependent, which build on prior problems, or
  path creating problems, which are novel functionalities or features. This article
  theorizes about the characteristics of the structure of collaboration in open collaboration,
  by drawing from a theory of organizational path constitution. The proposed theoretical
  framework argues that actors within a community do not only solve problems by themselves
  (i.e. independent problem solving), but other actors also solve other actorsÂ´ problems
  (i.e. shared problem solving). Furthermore, the proposed theoretical framework allows
  understanding the importance of who revealed the problem and what type of problem
  was revealed in independent and shared problem solving. We perform a multinomial
  logit model analysis using a two year data from a successful open source software
  development in Open Stack, in which all three types of actors identified more than
  5,000 problems. Our results provide novel empirical insights into the structure
  of open collaboration. In independent problem solving, our findings suggest that
  any actor solves novel problems rather than focusing on path dependent ones. However,
  in shared problem solving, firm actors focus only on novel problems revealed by
  independent or firm users. Moreover, independent users focus indiscriminately on
  improving prior problems and novel problems from firm users.'
