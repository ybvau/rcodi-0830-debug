### Using visualizations to nudge people into better choices

Data-driven feedback and interactions with personal devices are changing the way we make decisions. In our research project "Home energy monitoring", we design a new interactive visualization to create social motivations and foster more sustainable behavior. Visualization offers new language to frame our actions in alignment with social goals like energy conservation.
