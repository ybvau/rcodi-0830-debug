[![2016-02-10 14.05.07](https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2016-02-10-14.05.07-1-225x300.jpg)](https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2016-02-10-14.05.07-1.jpg)This week, the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation is enjoying the visit of Takeshi Ishikawa. Takeshi is a second year Master’s student in the Graduate School of Business & Commerce, Keio University, Japan. His research  focuses on relations between open innovation and organizational features (e.g. organizational culture, organizational capabilities or organizational structures). _” Right now, I’m researching about contributing factors in Japanese organizations when adopting technologies outside with conventional organizational theories”_, Takeshi says. The visit will be for a week this year, but he plans to come back for one of the prime open innovation hubs in the US: _“I’m planning to stay at the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation in 2017 with help by the Keio Program for Leading Graduate School (PLGS) and I am very excited for this opportunity”_, Takeshi says. We at RCODI will be looking forward to having him on our team in 2017.
