Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal publications. Our new article published in [Scientometrics](http://link.springer.com/journal/11192) is focused on the scientific impact of a platform’s programming community that produces these digital scientific innovations. Check it out [here](http://goo.gl/ggdULK).
