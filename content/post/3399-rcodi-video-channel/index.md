We are having more and more experts giving their hints about Open Source, Open Data and Open Innovation. This time, for our Purdue IronHack we have Jason Hibbets from Red Hat, Ben Cotton from HackLafayette, William Huang from Purdue Hackers and some others to share their expertise on different topics in order to encourage IronHackers to think out of the box to tackle the challenges behind the Gold and Black IronHacks. In the coming days, we’ll share more videos, interviews and interesting news about what’s going on with our Research Center Open Digital Innovation. Stay tuned. Check it out here: [https://vimeo.com/opendigital](https://vimeo.com/opendigital)
