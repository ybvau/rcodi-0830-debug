Are you excited about the open data movement and to join IronHacks as a sounding board member? Are you a graduate student generally excited about digital innovation who wants to be part of the movement? We invite coders, open data enthusiasts, and graduate students with a research interest in open data, crowds, and innovation to join us and learn more about IronHacks! We will offer free pizza and drinks! When: Wednesday September 16, @6:00pm Where: Discovery Learning Resource Center (DLRC), 207 South Martin Jischke Drive, West Lafayette, Room 143A/B
