## New scholar assistants from Colombia arrived to RCODI

After running the last version of The Ironhacks contest at Universidad Nacional de Colombia early this year, Cristian Baquero (left on the picture), winner on the Best Solution category, and Alejandro DÃ­az (left on the picture), Student ambassador of RCODI at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, arrived at Purdue University to assist the Ironhacks Team on research activities.

Both are students of Systems and Computing engineering at Universidad Nacional.

This is the first time Cristian visit the United States; "I am very grateful for the opportunity to be here at Purdue, I hope I can learn from Professor Brunswicker a lot and to experience the culture of this country" says Cristian.

Both students will be at campus till January 6th 2020.

For Alejandro, this is the second time he came to the States to assist the team as main software developer. He designed and programed the new version of The Ironhacks Platform, a web application that is used to run programing marathons online, which is the main tool used by the team to gather data. "I'm here to continue the development process with the team, we aim to run a contest around the world with hundreds of people participating at the same time, this is a very ambitious project!" he says.
