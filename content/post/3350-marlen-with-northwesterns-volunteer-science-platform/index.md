RCODI PhD student Marlen Promann has been invited to become a Virtual Research Fellow at Northwestern’s Volunteer Science. This fall, she will run a controlled experimental game on the Volunteer Science platform, testing how certain visual cues trigger people to make more cooperative (vs. self interested) decisions. Way to go Marlen!
