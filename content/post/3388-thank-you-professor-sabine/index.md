It marked one and a half year since I got to know Professor Sabine. Today is a special day as I won the battle with my fought with leukemia. When my condition worsened in earlier April, she stepped in quickly to complete the tasks that I was supposed to do. I am forever grateful. Professor Sabine has been the light of my life and a reminder to be positive, motivated and happy in life when I was struggling in between the boundary of life and death. Multiple messages from her asking if I was okay during my procedures, which touched my heart deeply. I would like to dedicate this post to her for her compassion and positive spirit that she has injected into my soul. She is not only a professor, but a lifelong mentor and adviser. This post is written with sincerity and gratefulness by Jay (Student in the School of Engineering, Purdue University)
