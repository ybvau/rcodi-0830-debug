The Blue [‪#‎IronHack‬](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ironhack?source=feed_text&story_id=503213856504888) officially and virtually kicked off on at Purdue University on Monday, November 9! It is a pleasure to see the hacking spirit alive and well, and we are excited to see the solutions created during the next 21 days!
