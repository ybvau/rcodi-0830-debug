Our Director Sabine Brunswicker and RCODI fellow Satyam Mukherjee have been [working on a paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3568249) that proposes a theory of design network motifs and conducts an empirical examination of this phenomena utilizing data from the Open Stack repository NOVA. The results of the study contribute to existing literature on design architecture as well as open collaboration by offering an explanation of hidden dependencies within a complex system architecture.
