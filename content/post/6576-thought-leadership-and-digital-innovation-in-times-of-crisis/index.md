RCODI Director Sabine Brunswicker recently gave a [keynote talk](https://www.ispim-innovation.com/post/sabine-brunswicker-on-responding-to-the-crisis-with-digital-innovation) as part of ISPIMâ€™s [virtual conference](https://www.ispim-virtual.com/) on responding to the COVID-19 crisis. The virtual conference was held June 7-10, 2020 with many leading researchers and experts in the interdisciplinary fields of innovation. As a top thought leader in this area, she discussed her passion for researching about digital platforms, and the interplay between AI and human intelligence. During the talk, Professor Brunswicker shared details on how crowds can help in responding to this type of complex epidemiological and economic crisis through digital innovation. In particular, digital innovation via crowds can help reduce levels of uncertainty while also focusing attention on flexibility, diversity of ideas, sustainability and resource efficiency. Additionally, Professor Brunswicker highlights how crises can create certain unexpected events and changes which make traditional AI models fragile, thus benefiting from the human intelligence component.

  
The original talk was presented on June 9th, 2020, but recordings are available from ISPIM through July 15th, 2020.
