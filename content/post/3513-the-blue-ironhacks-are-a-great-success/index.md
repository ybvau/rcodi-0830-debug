A group of motivated hackers finished their second out of three submissions last night at Midnight for the Blue IronHacks and are now up for judging by our expert panel. “The submissions so far have taken into account various problem aspects and settings, and it is truly impressive what the hackers are doing with Open Data”, said Cheryl Hsiang, one of our researchers and judges. Judging will take place over the next three days, before kicking off the final hacking phase on Thursday, November 11, and submitting the final solution Monday, November 23.
