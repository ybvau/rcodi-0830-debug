Our director is participating on the 80th annual meeting of the [Academy of Management](https://aom.org/).   What’s new is that this year the meeting is virtual. She will be a co-organizer of a LIVE Professional Development Workshop “What’s New About Digital Transformation? Exploring Interdisciplinary, Multi-Level Research Ideas,” along with five other experts from Switzerland, Italy, Denmark and Germany.  More than 250 have signed up to participate in the virtual workshop so we are eager how this virtual experience on a timely topic will play out!
