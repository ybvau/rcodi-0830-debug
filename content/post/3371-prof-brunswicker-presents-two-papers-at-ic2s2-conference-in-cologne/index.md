On July 12, 2017 our director [Sabine Brunswicker](https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/about/sabine/) presented 2 papers at the [International Conference on Computational Social Science in Cologne](http://www.ic2s2.org/). One paper on the role of network embeddedness in OSS project collaboration results from her joint research with Red Hat fellow [Satyam Mukherjee](https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/about/research-team/). The second paper provides insights on her work with collaborator [Michael Prietula, Emory](http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html) on transparency and reuse in open contests. In this work she links computational and empirical approaches to advance our understanding of collaborative problem solving and knowledge reuse (see also recent paper on [SSRN)](https://goo.gl/CQPsog).  For a full list of accepted talks at IC2S2 please visit this [conference website](https://ic2s2.org/2017/elements/accepted_talks.html).
