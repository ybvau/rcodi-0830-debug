RCODI would like to warmly welcome Na Cao. After having completed her Postdoc at Tsinghua University in 2014, she became a lecturer at the Information School, Capital University of Economics and Business in Beijing. During her one year at RCODI, Na Cao will work on energy analytics and its ability to identify new opportunities to reduce energy consumption with Associate Professor Sabine Brunswicker. Let’s all wish her the best!
