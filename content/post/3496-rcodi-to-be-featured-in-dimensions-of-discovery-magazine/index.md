The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation will have an article in the upcoming issue of Dimensions of Discovery Magazine, produced by Purdue University’s Office of the Vice President for Research. The magazine is issued four times throughout the academic year on a seasonal schedule. Articles include profiles of researchers, announcements of new grants and award winners, information on policies and resources for faculty members, and events. The mailing list includes faculty, research scientists and postdoctoral associates, as well as administrators and staff with responsibilities related to sponsored programs. The article will be mailed out on May 5, 2014. For more information, please click the link below.
