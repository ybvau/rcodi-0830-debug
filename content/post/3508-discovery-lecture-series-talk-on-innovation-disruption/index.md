Well-known and renowned business strategist, speaker, and author, Paul Nunes, will give a talk for the Discovery Lecture Series [“Big Bang Disruption: Strategy in the Age of Devastating Innovation”](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Bang-Disruption-Devastating-Innovation/dp/1591846900/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1443618684&sr=1-1&keywords=paul+nunes). Nunes is the Global Managing Director of the Accenture [Institute for High Performance](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/institute-for-high-performance.aspx), a global “think-and-act-tank” which aims to define and measure high-performance businesses. In his talk, Nunes will discuss the drivers of disruptive innovation in the global marketplace and how these lead to changes in strategy for businesses due to new forms of product lifecycles – innovation is simply more disruptive and happens faster than ever , and companies must learn to think differently. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is co-sponsoring this event, which is part of  a larger effort to build on Purdue’s strengths in computational systems, modeling, technology, engineering, the sciences and entrepreneurship in order to advance research and offer a research-based interdisciplinary graduate education in innovation. The talk will take place at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 7th in Discovery Park’s Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Room 121. **Source**: Sabine Brunswicker, 765-494-0880, [sbrunswi@purdue.edu](mailto:sbrunswi@purdue.edu)
