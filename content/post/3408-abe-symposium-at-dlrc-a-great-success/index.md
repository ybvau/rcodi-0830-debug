On a lovely Thursday morning and afternoon, Dr. Sabine Brunswicker delivered a plenary speech on the potential for Open Digital Innovation within the agricultural sector for agricultural & biological engineers at the ABE Graduate Symposium. Talking about the potential for platforms such as MyJohnDeere.com and OpenAg.io to bring together various forms of agricultural open data to create more efficient agriculture, interest was high among the participants. We thank the ABE Graduate Student Association for putting together a great event and look forward to the bright future of data-driven agriculture.
