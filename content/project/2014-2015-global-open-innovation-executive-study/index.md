Open innovation is growing into a mainstream phenomenon of increasing business relevance in large firms where 78 percent of large firms in the sample had been applying open innovation.
### Global Open Innovation Executive Study

In 2012, a large-scale Open Innovation Executive Survey was conducted by UC- Berkeley and Fraunhofer-Society to explore to what extent open innovation was applied in large firms in the USA and Europe. 

Results show, open innovation is growing into a mainstream phenomenon of increasing business relevance in large firms where 78 percent of large firms in the sample had been applying open innovation, although they were in the early stage of practicing and understanding open innovation. To access the survey report, please click [here](http://goo.gl/wC6qRT).

Building upon these results, there is a need to advance our understanding of adoption of open innovation at project level. Existing academic literature and theories on open innovation have regularly focused on firm-level aggregates to understand the role of open innovation in firm performance; they have not provided sufficient insights into the adoption of open innovation at a project level. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at the Purdue University and the [Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation](http://corporateinnovation.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California-Berkeley in collaboration with [Fraunhofer-Society](https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html) want to address this gap by conducting this research. We implemented the second Open Innovation Executive Survey in order to deepen our understanding of adoption of open innovation not only at firm-level but also at project level. In a nutshell, in this research project, we aim to implement a quantitative survey study on open innovation among senior executives in large firms in the USA, Europe and Japan with the main focus on different open innovation practices, new practices, ways to deal with managing and sharing know-how and IP, and new ways to measure open innovation performance.

Duration: 22 months (3/2014-1/2016)
