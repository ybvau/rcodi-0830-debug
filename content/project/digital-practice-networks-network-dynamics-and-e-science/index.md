This research is aimed at comparing the network effects formed in online digital platforms of participating scientists to “traditional” research and collaboration methods.
### Effect of Online Digital Communities to Members Output (Success) and Choices (Contagion): The Case NanoHUB Cyberinfrastructure

The primary research questions that sparked this project were: (1) How does scientist output depend upon their embeddedness in digital spaces in NanoHUB.org cyerinfrastructure?; (2) What are the network formation structures and characteristics of an open digital platform?; (3) How do tools traverse (diffuse) amongst users in NanoHUB.org cyberinfrastructure?

Using data from the NanoHUB.org cyberinfrastructure analyzed using network science, spatial econometics, and network social modelling techniques, this research is aimed at comparing the network effects formed in online digital platforms of participating scientists to “traditional” research and collaboration methods.

The formation, mechanism, and process of networks that influence scientists output in digital platforms, like with NanoHUB.org, is limited and contradictory. According to Klimeck et al and nanoHUB.org,  nanoHub.org is a novel science and engineering ecosystem comprised of self-organized researchers, educators, and professionals in eight member institutions that collaborate, share resources, and solve nanotechnology related problems. Results of this project identify the organizational and structural effects of digital platforms to members’ developmental success in addition to diffusion of tools in user community. Also, the network social modelling reveals the network formation patterns and characteristics of online digital platforms.

Duration: 2014 to 2016
