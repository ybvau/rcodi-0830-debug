Working in conjunction with [Bright Idea](http://www.brightidea.com/), a leading Open Innovation Platform provider, we are testing the impact of selective anonymity, where participants can flag their contributions to be displayed anonymously.
### Increasing Creativity through Anonymous Dissent 2015

Employees within an organization are often encouraged to contribute to internal Open Innovation Challenges, however, the creativity of their contributions may be limited by their perceived freedom to express ideas and opinions that are against majority opinions or organizational norms. Troublesome ideas and opinions may impact their work reputation, standing within the organization, and even their future employment.

One option is to make all contributions to internal Open Innovation Challenges anonymous, however, that would reduce the social and reputational rewards associated with participation and co-creation of solutions. Working in conjunction with [Bright Idea](http://www.brightidea.com/), a leading Open Innovation Platform provider, we are testing the impact of selective anonymity, where participants can flag their contributions to be displayed anonymously. Using selective anonymity, participants can enjoy all the usual reputational and social rewards that are accrued while participating in an Open Innovation Challenge, while simultaneously offering risk-free minority dissent, which is necessary to increase the diversity of opinions and inspire creativity.

We are Partnering with [Landcare Research](http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/home), one of seven Crown Research organizations in New Zealand,  to test the effects of selective anonymity on participant contributions. Utilizing a strategic planning question that is of pressing importance to the organization, we will assist Landcare Research by running an internal Open Innovation Challenge on the Bright Idea platform, which includes the opportunity for selective anonymity, and instructions to guide participants in the importance of anonymous contributions.

Duration: 6 months (3/2015-8/2015)
