	abstract = {New IronHacks software is developed as a tool for running multiphase hackathons, which is also the first tool developed to run hackathons in a tightly controlled environment. The IronHacks software is a user interface where participants create their solutions. It also acts as a hackathon manager that enables the footprints left by the solutions’ creators to be tracked down. To model the real-world reuse scenario that will lead to the development of a robust reuse model, advancing the current search engine in locating relevant source codes to be reused, it is essential for the experiments to be run in a tightly controlled environment where each participant is given the same set of tools to create their solutions on. This piece of work describes a novel graphical user interface design that enables treatment conditions to be manipulated and tractions to be captured for each group of solutions’ creators all on a standard environment. This program greatly expands the possibilities for researchers to extend the literature of reuse in the software engineering domain.},

	abstract = {In this lightning talk, I will introduce a coding bot that I built together with Prof. Sabine Brunswicker, my
mentor in Purdue University and PhD advisor to-be, where functions predictions in our recommender
system is achieved by using neural nets on sentiment classifier to classify data. Inspired by the eminent
neural conversational model built by Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le in Cornell University, we incorporated the
‘sequence to sequence’ model when training our coding bot. Exploiting properties of neural nets, our new
approach provides guarantees on the accuracy of the results as neural nets don’t analyze text, which is
the functions wrote by programmers, at face value unlike the traditional approach that dissects the texts
into smaller tokens, counts the number of times each token shows up and utilizes the ‘bag of words’
model, which is commonly called the ‘dictionary’ to compute the overall subjectivity of the text with the
subjectivity of each word pre-recorded. Our new approach, however, will train the classifier and the given
new function will be classified in a different category. Based on the theory of ‘sequence to sequence’
model, I will introduce the concept of representing different recurrent neural network in function
predictions with different sets of parameters each, where the function is given few data points to learn
from the hidden previous function and also the current function. Our model not only learns from the data
injected by programmers but how it learns before. When predicting sequences of functions by converting
text to vector or numerical representations, we not only predict based on the previous functions but all
the functions that came before it by estimating the probability of certain contexts and learning a
similarity function where the reply to the programmer is one of the elements in a predefined pool of
possible answers. This ability to mimic programmers’ thoughts lead to a more efficient coding process
where programmers just have to describe what they want to do to the coding bot to have the relevant
functions inserted for them into their software applications.},

	abstract = {New visual similarity technology based on SSIM is developed as a
 tool for measuring visual similarities of multiple web applications
 of different sizes, which is the first technology model that targets
 web components of different sizes. This visual similarity technology
takes screenshots of the web applications in the background and
extracts the components needed for further study. For finding
visual similarities between different components on the web
applications, it is essential for the algorithms to be able to handle
 components of varying sizes, after components extractions have
 been performed by the visual similarity technology. This work
describes a new algorithmic implementation for the detection  of visual similarities of various web components developed. The
 new implementation extends upon the SSIM algorithm that
measure the visual similarity of images of similar sizes.
The program portrays successful detection of visually similar
 charts and maps of different sizes in the web applications.
This implementation greatly expands the possibilities to investigate
visual reuse between web applications' developers.},

	title = {Optimizing and {Satisficing}: {The} {Interplay} {Between} {Platform} {Architecture} and {Producers}’ {Design} {Strategies} for {Platform} {Performance}},
	abstract = {Two-sided platforms are gaining increasing attention in practice and as the subject of IS and management research. We explore an assumption of research and practice: that a platform’s architecture needs to be decoupled so that producers can easily mix and match the platform’s design elements (APIs, code libraries, process models, etc.) into apps that perform well competitively, and insulate the platform from skewed outcomes and low market performance. However, in practice, complete decoupling is not just difficult but almost impossible. Based on more than two million runs of an exploratory NK model in which producers use a platform’s design space for the creation of apps, we generate several surprising insights. First, we show that tighter coupling may not necessarily be harmful depending on the producers’ design strategies and the amount of constraints placed on design elements. Second, we observe that if moderate to tightly coupled platforms with optimizing producers focused exclusively on being competitive, platform performance is lower compared to platforms with satisficing producers who put a lower priority of being competitive because of other interests. This is surprising since optimizers are better suited to cope with the inherent uncertainty of coupling. Finally, moderately coupled platforms can outperform platforms with loose coupling when constraints nudge producers into distant design moves while also isolating them from downside uncertainty. These three findings offer implications for multiple streams of literature on platform architectures.},

	abstract = {Along with environmental awareness, the interdisciplinary field of eco-feedback has become an active research interest in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computing, and Sustainable Design. While designers face the challenge of designing complex socio-technical systems (Norman and Stappers 2015), eco-feedback lacks comprehensive theoretical contributions to guide such efforts. This paper followed the PRISMA-P structured review method and reports on mostly empirical papers (N=36) on eco-feedback design from the past decade (2006-2016). The aim was to systematize the emerging field by classifying feedback types according to their impact on end users and identify theoretical grounding. Through our deep inductive engagement with the studies, we present four eco-feedback affordances: (1) Inform for awareness change; (2) Incentivize for motivation change; (3) Educate for behavioral change; and (4) Control for convenience. Current research is corroborating empirical evidence in support of eco-feedback, but their lack of theoretical grounding has resulted in incomparable constructs and inconsistent results.},

We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach.},

	abstract = {The success of software development projects depends on carefully coordinating the effort of many individuals across the multiple stages of the development process. In software engineering, modularization is the traditional technique intended to reduce the interdependencies among modules that constitute a system. Reducing technical dependencies, the theory argues, results in a reduction of work dependencies between teams developing interdependent modules. Although that research stream has been quite influential, it considers a static view of the problem of coordination in engineering activities. Building on a dynamic view of coordination, we studied the relationship between socio-technical congruence and software quality and development productivity. In order to investigate the generality of our findings, our analyses were performed on two large-scale projects from two companies with distinct characteristics in terms of product and process maturity. Our results revealed that the gaps between coordination requirements and the actual coordination activities carried out by the developers significantly increased software failures. Our analyses also showed that higher levels of congruence are associated with improved development productivity. Finally, our results showed the congruence between dependencies and coordinative actions is critical both in mature development settings as well as in novel and dynamic development contexts.},

Existing designs of open data contests adopt transparency in different ways and report positive and negative implications for the innovation productivity of the contest contributors. This paper studies the role of transparency as an essential socio-technical design principle of open data contest platforms. It proposes two design features of transparency, namely performance transparency and solution transparency that allow the crowd to develop novel open data applications by integrating entrepreneurial experimentation with re-use for innovation. Adopting a design science method, we develop and test an open data contest platform design that jointly affords performance and solution transparency. Our pilot study of an open data mash-up hackathon provides evidence that these transparency features trigger both independent path creation and re-use for innovation. The result also shows mere copying will not result in good performance.

	abstract = {There is a conundrum when a firm engages deeply with external sources in its open innovation projects. This conundrum is related to the simultaneous activities of knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting. Many studies about open innovation have focused on the role of legal formalization in the context of intellectual property (IP) control. But legal formalization around IP may not address more specific activities of the parties such as tacit knowledge of involved individuals that may lead to revealing too much knowledge. In this study, we introduce formality into the joint technology development process itself, an alternative form of formalization, to manage this conundrum. Moreover, we argue that as the firm attempts to solve more complex problems, the importance of the formal joint process increases. We test our argument based on a sample of 82 open innovation projects collected from large firms in the United States and Europe. Our results clearly indicate that to manage the conundrum of simultaneously engaging in knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting, formalizing the joint technology development process seems to have a positive effect on projects outcomes that gets stronger as the problem becomes complex. We contribute to external sourcing literature by suggesting that the process formalization may support the legal formalization of IP control to manage the knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Moreover, we make important theoretical contributions to literature regarding relational mechanisms in interorganizational collaborations through our assertion that the combination of formality and informality between the partners seems to be required to increase the likelihood of success of open innovation projects without the loss of critical intellectual property.},

	title = {Who {Solves} {Whose} {Problem} in {Open} {Collaboration}?},
	abstract = {Digital technologies have transformed how firms and individuals collaborate while giving rise to the phenomenon of open collaboration. Open collaboration, which originated in open source software, has spread beyond software. Open collaboration communities usually have three types of actors who collaborate by selectively revealing problems and solutions. These actors, that propose problems and solution to the community, are: 1) independent users, 2) firm users, and 3) firm producers. The proposed problems can be either path dependent, which build on prior problems, or path creating problems, which are novel functionalities or features. This article theorizes about the characteristics of the structure of collaboration in open collaboration, by drawing from a theory of organizational path constitution. The proposed theoretical framework argues that actors within a community do not only solve problems by themselves (i.e. independent problem solving), but other actors also solve other actors´ problems (i.e. shared problem solving). Furthermore, the proposed theoretical framework allows understanding the importance of who revealed the problem and what type of problem was revealed in independent and shared problem solving. We perform a multinomial logit model analysis using a two year data from a successful open source software development in Open Stack, in which all three types of actors identified more than 5,000 problems. Our results provide novel empirical insights into the structure of open collaboration. In independent problem solving, our findings suggest that any actor solves novel problems rather than focusing on path dependent ones. However, in shared problem solving, firm actors focus only on novel problems revealed by independent or firm users. Moreover, independent users focus indiscriminately on improving prior problems and novel problems from firm users.},

	abstract = {Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a platform’s programming community that produces these digital scientific innovations. The article’s main theoretical argument is that beyond an individual’s contribution efforts to these innovations, a new social structure affects his scientific recognition through citations of his tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory lens, we introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who jointly work on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces among the community members in an analogy to Newton’s gravity concept. Our model represents such dependencies in a spatial autocorrelative model. We empirically estimate this model using data of the programming community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers have contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a programmer’s contributions to digital innovations may have positive effects, while the digital practice structure creates negative dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being surrounded by star performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling scientific impact needs to account for a scientist’s contribution to programming communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital work structures in which these contributions are embedded.},

	abstract = {The established stream of literature on design architectures argues that designers should aim for modular architecture in order increase the system’s technical performance by lowering the propagation costs of the system’s design: A system with a small stable “core”, a cycle of coupled parts of the system, and a large variable periphery reduce the risk of technical feature and increase opportunity for innovation. However, such a core-periphery view ignores the micro-level dependency structures that emerge in open collaboration when a large number of developers produce a complex technical system at distance, virtually, and outside of formal employment relationships. In this paper, we develop a theory of design network motifs that accounts for the smallest design dependencies in the system that emerge in situ. Informed by the network theoretical concept of a “motif”, we introduce design motifs as the smallest unit of design interdependencies in a system architecture and develop a theory of design network motifs describe each system’s ‘motif fingerprint’ and explains how certain motif patterns affect the performance of a system as a whole. We empirically examine our design network motif theory using architectural data of the Open Stack repository NOVA, consisting of 2359 files and 1545532 lines of code. We extract all potential design network motifs created by 872 developers for 5 years. Our results show that design network motifs offer a new way to explain hidden dependencies in complex system architectures. Surprisingly, it is not just cycling that significantly impact a system’s performance but instead, a “feed-forward loop” motif. Our results contribute to the literature on design architectures and open collaboration more broadly.},

	abstract = {Formal de jure Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) coordinate the development of compatibility standards that ensure technological progress and welfare through interoperability. Informal SDOs, which are self-organized and not mandated by law, co-exist with formal SDOs to develop compatibility standards in a substituting or complementing way. As a result, the process of standardization evolves within and across multiple SDOs. An examination of the process of managing standardization across collaborating formal and informal SDOs can fundamentally change our theoretical understanding of governance of standardization. Drawing upon the tensions-based view, we argue that fundamental characteristics of the co-existence of complementary standardization are dynamic and contradictory. To balance such tensions, generative responses within and across formal and informal SDOs are required. This two-staged case study research examines the emergence of five tensions throughout the collaboration of two SDOs, HL7 and ISO, in health informatics. Our results explain the contradictory nature of five tensions with respect to (1) technological functions, (2) legal purview and geographic scope, (3) trigger, (4) time, and (5) usage/IPR and how they evolve over time. We also empirically derive three governance responses to such tensions, namely dynamic and multi-level roles, dynamic processes, and evolving resources; these responses allow members of the SDOs to respond to these tensions in a way that succeeds in managing the process of standardization. This research provides a novel theoretical understanding of governance of standardization for innovation. We conclude with recommendations for policy makers and standards developers.},

	abstract = {In complex Open Source Software (OSS) development projects, coordination structures emerge from dyadic code
interactions of dispersed developers. Prior research uses methods of network science to understand the evolution of OSS
developer coordination. In this paper, we examine how endogenous network properties predict the formation of OSS
coordination structures. We specify an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*) to study the significance of two relational
mechanisms: Preferential attachment and knowledge similarity. We empirically estimate our model using granular development
data of 619 developers in Nova, one of the oldest projects of OpenStack, working on 2597 Python files between 2012 and 2016.
We find statistical evidence of positive non-linear (rather than linear) preferential attachment which cause skewed distributions
distinct from a power-law. Further, we show that knowledge similarity has a significantly positive effect. Non-linear preferential
attachment explains the formation of developer relationships across long evolutionary periods but knowledge similarity impacts
only early stages. Our findings contribute to literature on software evolution and management},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of project-level external knowledge search breadth and search depth on the innovation performance of open innovation (OI) projects in large firms; it further considers these effects mediated by two forms of control mechanisms (process and outcome control) when the level of project complexity and the two stages of a project – early (problem definition) and late (solution development) – are taken into account. Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey of 187 managers responsible for an OI project, the authors use theory on behavioral-based control mechanisms to explore whether the effect of external knowledge search breadth and depth on OI performance is contingent on having the right levels of control mechanisms in place. Findings The results showed that the control mechanism mediates the relationship between external knowledge search breadth and depth and OI project performance. Furthermore, project complexity is an important moderator of these effects, especially for outcome control. Originality/value A better OI project’s performance is not achieved by external knowledge search breadth and depth alone, but by building process and outcome control mechanism on it to balance knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Furthermore, Outcome control is only helpful with less complex OI projects.},

	abstract = {Innovation is a cumulative process in which past knowledge created by others can be both a source for predictable outcomes and also a barrier to significant change. The recent literature on digital innovation suggests that open platforms, which encourage their developers to build upon each other's knowledge when innovating their add-on apps in the periphery, face a related paradox. Developers face the tension of either being coherent with the past, or flexible to adjust to the future. In this paper, we examine how the trade-off between coherent and flexible search mechanisms affects the individual developer's choice of innovating a certain app as well as his or her cumulative impact, i.e., the degree of modifications to the app. We study an open platform in the multi-disciplinary field of nanotechnology, in which 480 developers perform more than 30,000 problem-solving actions over a period of 10 years. We use relational event modeling to differentially assess the effect of the coherent and flexible search strategies. We find that developers are significantly more likely to choose a certain app that is consistent with both a coherent and flexible strategy. However, a coherent strategy leads to greater cumulative impact on an app compared to a strategy of being mutually coherent and flexible. Thus, our findings indicate both a complementary and a contradictory logic in how the tension between coherence and flexibility unfolds. We make contributions to the recent literature on digital innovation as well as the innovation literature more broadly. Further, our results inform innovation policy and platform design.},
