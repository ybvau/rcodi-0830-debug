      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fact&#34;&gt;What is FACT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federated-AI for Communication and Trust (FACT) platform is envisioned to be an open, federated AI that will continuously evaluate professional and civic news streams, assign trust rating to content and sources, and progressively adjust their ratings as new and also untold stories are generated and shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FACT integrates an assemble of AI models that augment the memory and the &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; of users. It&amp;rsquo;s a distributed AI platform that federates through self-organization and novel human-AI interaction design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FACT episodic memory engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stores historical facts and sources of news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traces news content and degree of distortion over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigns trust rating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FACT intelligence engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generates narratives based on facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produces counterfactuals and &amp;ldquo;untold&amp;rdquo; stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rates trust rating of new articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facts-impact&#34;&gt;FACT&amp;rsquo;S Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary audience of FACT are ~ 30 % of the citizens living in the U.S, who are active on the social media. Using  textual, chart-based as well as conversational interactive feedback, FACT&amp;rsquo;s interface can influence end-user interpretations as well news creation, prompting continued action (such as further propagation of fact-based retweets and stories, or writing of news article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literacy about AI and distortion of news content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased trust in news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civic and Professional Journalists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence in writing trustworthy stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention to untold stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New models for federated AI combining agent-based modeling, GAN, and human-AI interaction/design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral studies/insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facts-deliverables&#34;&gt;FACT&amp;rsquo;s Deliverables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel FACT platform distributed AI with novel human-AI interaction design:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory engine (Hebbian learning &amp;amp; agent-based simulation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligence engine (generative adversarial networks &amp;amp; agent-based modeling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human-AI interaction design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data and evaluation from controlled experiments with 500+ citizens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lab &amp;amp; field experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing effect of FACT for citizens vis-à-vis professional writers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact measures: literacy, perceived trust, confidence, and behavioral change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~250 new FACT-based stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT channel reporting to broader audience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News produced with FACT by citizen journalists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-authored work with advisory board&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our information is increasingly data based and our decisions are increasingly guided by data graphs, charts and visualizations. Yet, the dominantly individualist data presentation perspectives utilized in current feedback systems have failed to leverage social behavioral theories to design technologically mediated feedback that could enhance individuals&#39; awareness of and their willingness to cooperate with the digitally interconnected others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ENERGYVIS Project was created to gain deeper insight into how the visual structure of a data graph affects the interpretation and comprehension of the data the chart represents and how they might nudge us to more cooperative choices. Little research has examined the role data visualization design plays in shaping behavior in the context of collective action (e.g., recycling, energy conservation, public protest, juries or organizational committees) that require cooperation and pooling of efforts of individual members, often on a voluntary basis. In such dilemmas, everybody is better off if individuals align with the group goal; however, these tasks typically fail because many do not align with the group&amp;rsquo;s goal. In addition to visual encoding patterns to enhance individuals&#39; social awareness and cooperation, this project will offer resources for new cognitive and perceptual experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-experiments&#34;&gt;Our Experiments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that data based feedback has the potential to make people more aware and cognizant of their synergy decisions. What is lacking is the consideration of the subtle ways in which design details of data based charts frame how people perceive, understand and act in response to the feedback charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We extend visual perception theory by borrowing from group identity literature, which suggests that perceiving a unified group is required for group alignment and continued commitment. So, we hypothesize that seeing and identifying with a perceivably unified group can sustain users&#39; energy conservation efforts. We use social computational methods to study the effects of visual graph structures and motion effects on graph perceptions, interpretations and user actions and consolidate a set of design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;perception-and-interpretation-experiments&#34;&gt;Perception and Interpretation Experiments.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We marry theories of visual perception and group identity to deliver theory driven chart designs that support collective awareness. Our perceptual experiments explore how these visual graph structures increase the perception of group unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;behavioural-game-studies-focused-on-action&#34;&gt;Behavioural Game Studies Focused on Action.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build on existing behavioral game literature and propose a new visualization oriented game framework. We use the behavioral game to explore how the visual graph structures nudge individuals to more cooperative behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>/project/reinforcement-learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 04:47:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/reinforcement-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-would-you-teach-a-child-to-play-a-video-game&#34;&gt;How would you teach a child to play a video game?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might sit down with them, put the controller in their hands, and push buttons with them. You might do the first level with them, and have them copy what you do until they get it down exactly right. They’ll learn pretty quickly - if they have the right aptitude - and they’d be able to teach their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s pretty unlikely that they’ll be better than you by the time you’re done teaching them. If they choose to seek out different teachers - Twitch streamers, that kid at school - then odds are low they’ll get better than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is another approach. It only requires the kid having an unrealistically large amount of time and no real needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just lock them in the room and tell them to leave once they get a perfect score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll start off by trying random things, hoping to stumble across some strategies that yield positive outcomes. Over time, they’ll develop some balance between doing things they know work well and trying new things. Eventually, by the time they get their perfect score, the tactics they use will be entirely original, unsullied by the influence of you or any of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the basis of reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a parent should never lock their kid in a room under such circumstances, having computers play a game millions of times without telling them how to go about it has led to groundbreaking developments. The famous AlphaGo and AlphaZero agents used reinforcement learning to develop the world’s best Go AI and beat top-ranked human player Lee Sedol. Google uses this same technique to manage their data center’s energy consumption. Scientists have been harnessing the power of reinforcement learning to study protein synthesis, advertisement placement, and robots. Reinforcement learning does not learn from humans; as a result, it is free to explore beyond the bounds of our limited creativities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works by having the person define four key components:
The environment
The rewards
The actions
When the game ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the reinforcement learning agent will play the game by itself many, many times (up to billions!) until it has figured out a strategy. What does that strategy look like? Internally, the agent will have figured out an expected value for each state it will encounter based on its experiences. It will then choose the actions that lead to the best future outcomes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At RCODI, my research revolves around using a variant of reinforcement learning - one where multiple agents learn to compete against one another - to model human behavior in the public goods game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collective action game is a social experiment designed to illustrate how people behave in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round, every player is given $10. They can contribute some amount (none, any, or a partial amount) to a group pool or they can pocket some themselves. After the rounds are over, the amount of money in the pool is multiplied by a constant and evenly distributed to each player. The amount of money a player has at the end of the game is the sum of however much they saved and their portion from the group pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everyone could coordinate, then they would all donate $10 each round to make a lot of money. However, it turns out that one would make more money if they convinced everyone else to donate each round but they saved their own money. Moreover, in practice, nobody wants to be the sucker donating everything while others save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, most people will act based on how the others playing the game will act. They will donate a lot if others are contributing a lot, and they will donate little if others are donating a little. This is called conditional cooperation. About 70% of people will play this game in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research involves studying how the information available to the player influences their behavior. I model a conditionally cooperative agent using a rules-based model and two reinforcement learning agents. The rules-based model simulates whether or not the agent should be competitive or cooperative, and then the reinforcement learning agent will take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement learning agent will analyze the given situation and recommend a contribution. The recommendations are based on the reinforcement learning agent having played the collective action game millions and millions of times until it figures out how to maximize its own balance or the group’s (for competitive and cooperative respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are still under way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transparency in Open Data Contest</title>
      <link>/project/transparency-in-open-data-contest/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2010 22:24:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/transparency-in-open-data-contest/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study measures the degree of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; to determine the effect of transparency on participation and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transparency-in-open-data-contest&#34;&gt;Transparency in Open Data Contest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Research Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the effects of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and solution &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; on participation and innovativeness of Open Data solutions in Open Data contests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does transparency in open data contests affect civic participation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does transparency influence the novelty, usefulness, and popularity of open data solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in the way agencies and citizens evaluate the innovativeness of these solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of &amp;lsquo;first-of-its-kind&amp;rsquo; 3 weeks fully virtual hacks known as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/purdue-ironhacks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Purdue IronHacks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, we explore &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;participation&lt;/em&gt; in Open Data (OD) solutions in OD contests. The OD project introduces the concept of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; in OD contests. We draw upon the theory of private-collective innovation, self-organizing governance and our previous research in organizing innovation contests, collective action, and open public policy and problem solving. The goal of this project is to provide a new perspective on how to promote impact from governmental OD. Using machine readable open datasets from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.data.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data.gov&lt;/a&gt; focusing on the areas of: Health, Energy, Climate, Education, Finance, Public Safety, and Global Development, we conduct an empirical quantitative study to explain the effect of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; on governmental OD impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a data driven and computational research approach, in a series of quasi-experimental OD contests, several hundred citizens, developers, and students will participate in a ‘virtual’ lab environment. Non-expert citizens and developers will collaborate to identify problems, share different perspectives, critical decisions, and seek solutions. The degree of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; will be measured in order to determine the effect of transparency on participation and innovation. Findings from these experiments will be implemented in larger national OD contests, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackforchange.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. In sum, this study will provide evidence-based guidelines for the design of OD contests and how to utilize transparency and knowledge sharing to increase the impact of governmental OD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study aims to understand how Open Source Software practices are evolving by focusing on studying a prominent community &amp;lsquo;OpenStack&amp;rsquo; that is effectively using the latest practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modeling-complex-open-source-software-structures-as-networks&#34;&gt;Modeling Complex Open Source Software Structures as Networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the commitment to foster and build Open Source Software practices, Red Hat Inc. sponsors a two-year Red Hat fellowship for Discovery Park&amp;rsquo;s Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Inc. provided a 100,000$ gift to Purdue to advance in this field led by technology and innovation professor Sabine Brunswicker. The objective of Red Hat funding this fellowship is to establish itself as a &amp;ldquo;significant catalyst of open-digital innovation ecosystems and communities research intended to answer questions critical to the sustainable impact of open standards and open-source and novel open forms of innovation and production in a broader sense,&amp;rdquo; Brunswicker said. Open Source Software is lately gaining traction in fields that traditionally were considered to be close as telecommunication, health care, or even banking. Therefore, this fellowship is divided in two different stages. The first stage is to understand how Open Source Software practices are evolving by focusing on studying a prominent community &amp;lsquo;OpenStack&amp;rsquo; that is effectively using the latest practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is a set of software tools for managing and building public and private cloud computing platform. The second stage is researching how these practices can be applied to other fields as telecommunications. Through the fellowship research on architecture, governance and behaviors of heterogeneous open-innovation communities as OpenStack will be examined. Research results will be shared with Red Hat as part of a collaborative dialogue between these two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-open-innovation-with-business-impact-in-the-digital-age&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Open Innovation with Business Impact in the Digital Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Accenture Institute for High Performance (AIHP), we have implemented a series of open innovation (OI) case studies to generate new insights on how large, innovative firms use open innovation to solve their strategic innovation problems. One particular example concluded in 2017 is that of Samsung, and its endeavor to seek IoT prototypes created by communities participating in an open innovatoin challenge. Read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000__w__/gb-en/_acnmedia/pdf-43/accenture-open-innovation-at-samsung.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Brunswicker and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increased digital transformation of many sectors, such problems are increasingly difficult to address. Our preliminary research suggests that one of the keys to running a successful open innovation program is choosing the correct operational mode of open innovation for the business problem at hand. This requires evaluating problem complexity and knowledge uncertainty associated with a business problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of companies who have chosen to integrate open innovation have realized that there are specific management practices required to effectively execute open innovation. Open innovation problems can involve a high level of uncertainty and technological complexity and require firms to move from traditional modes of collaboration (such as alliances) towards more open interactions with deeper exchanges of know-how and greater ambiguity such as crowds and communities. There are management challenges specific to open innovation that require a unique set of strategies and processes to be in place in order to overcome these challenges and be able to achieve higher business value through open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation by selecting the appropriate open innovation model, and integrating successful management strategies to balance the tensions of knowledge sharing and protection in the midst of strategic and operational ambiguity. This framework will also equip open innovation leaders with new insights into successful practices for creating business impact from open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ironhacks&#34;&gt;IronHacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is an open data hacking program that empowers programmers - from beginners to professionals - to solve civic challenges during a multi-phase and learning-oriented process.  The IronHacks platform offers participants a no-set-up programming environment and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations that help citizens and governments to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-challenges&#34;&gt;Example challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;covid-19-data-science-challenge&#34;&gt;COVID-19 Data Science Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use data provided by suppliers such as SafeGraph to predict areas that will be impacted by  COVID-19 based on foot traffic.
What are the Challenges about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our COVID-19 Data Science Challenges invite participants to build statistical models and visualizations that monitor and predict social movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic over time. The goal is to predict weekly patterns of movement and social interaction in our local communities to understand COVID-19 risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: This first COVID-19 Data Science Challenge focuses on predicting the foot traffic at major brands (e.g. Target, Domino&amp;rsquo;s Pizza etc.). The goal is to foresee which brands are experiencing the greatest surge in visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: Protect Purdue. This challenge asks participants to monitor and predict weekly foot traffic at thousands of places of interests (e.g. restaurants, stores, churches) in the Greater West-Lafayette. It responds to a statement made by Purdue&amp;rsquo;s Leadership team: that COVID-19 risk is not necessarily arising in campus buildings but, rather, emerging from off-campus social gatherings like in restaurants, shops, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants have access to BIG actual, granular and temporal data they typically do not have access to: Data about social distancing behavior, foot traffic, COVID-19 incidents, as well as executive orders. This data is also used by state governments in the US as well scientists who try to understand social movements during COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with this data, participants will work in the IronHacks workspace with JupyterLab and access to BigQuery to create novel and useful statistical models and visualizations using Python and R. Participants will submit Jupyter notebooks and their outputs (html and markdown files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;affordable-housing&#34;&gt;AFFORDABLE HOUSING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./topics-housing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a website with interactive visualizations that helps new students in finding safe and affordable housing near their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workforce-analytics&#34;&gt;WORKFORCE ANALYTICS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./14_1-2X1-e1522941729110.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use workforce data to explore factors that affect successful career paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-process-work&#34;&gt;How does the process work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IronHacks is a global virtual open data hacking platform that allows users to participate in a high-energy IronHacks competition. The IronHacks platform offers participants a no setup workspace with JupyterLab and BigQueryintegration and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations. It also offers training and tutorials, as well as a personal dashboard to view scores and progress through the competition. After registration, participants can warm-up, practice their skills and query sample data until sufficient participants have joined to launch the competition. After the start of the competition, a multiphase process will start. Each challenge moves through the following phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-submission-there-will-be-a-final-submission-before-we-identify-the-winners&#34;&gt;Registration and warm-up phase: If you have registered for one of the Challenges that are available, you will have the opportunity to warm-up using our tutorials.
Start of competition followed by multiphase process: The competition starts based on invitation, usually followed by multiple interim and one final submission Interim submissions: At multiple interim submission points, you will receive immediate feedback on your current standing, giving you the opportunity to improve over time.
Final submission: There will be a final submission before we identify the winners.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-impact&#34;&gt;Our Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific team at Purdue generated new knowledge and technologies on the implications of machine-enabled feedback and transparency on participant&amp;rsquo;s productivity and innovation performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, thousands of participants have hacked in parallel virtually around the globe gaining valuable experience in coding as well as work for the chance to win internships, Amazon gift cards, cool swag, and certificates. In addition to the students participation and learning, IronHacks provide the opportunity to do research on open innovation contest processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants developed novel and useful open data solutions in an interactive environment. The platform&amp;rsquo;s features helped them continuously improve their submissions while learning from real-time feedback and others participating in the hack. A new virtual movement of hacking has emerged at Purdue and beyond. Participants come from the U.S., Colombia, and China. Virtual setting encourages a more diverse audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rapid&#34;&gt;RAPID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a collaborative project where RCODI works alongside Software Factory Labs (SFL) to conduct research concerning engagement and performance of R&amp;amp;D contacts. With government contracting, there are types of parties that are consistently applying and winning contracts. DARPA solicited the general public for a means to address the segmented competition within contracts, with the hopes of engaging more small businesses, opening the narrowly-perceived corridor for defense contract innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCODI and SFL are currently exploring the reasons behind such a limited workforce with the hopes of enabling more small business participation within government contracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration is currently on-going.&lt;/p&gt;
