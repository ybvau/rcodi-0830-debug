 abstract = {In complex Open Source Software (OSS) development projects, coordination structures emerge from dyadic code
interactions of dispersed developers. Prior research uses methods of network science to understand the evolution of OSS
developer coordination. In this paper, we examine how endogenous network properties predict the formation of OSS
coordination structures. We specify an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*) to study the significance of two relational
mechanisms: Preferential attachment and knowledge similarity. We empirically estimate our model using granular development
data of 619 developers in Nova, one of the oldest projects of OpenStack, working on 2597 Python files between 2012 and 2016.
We find statistical evidence of positive non-linear (rather than linear) preferential attachment which cause skewed distributions
distinct from a power-law. Further, we show that knowledge similarity has a significantly positive effect. Non-linear preferential
attachment explains the formation of developer relationships across long evolutionary periods but knowledge similarity impacts
only early stages. Our findings contribute to literature on software evolution and management},
