      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCODI Fellows Mai Elkady, Feny Patel, and RCODI Director Dr. Sabine Brunswicker recently wrote about research on skills and engagement relative to Collective Intelligence. The three were  and were invited to present at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm-ci2021.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2021 ACM-CI Conference&lt;/a&gt; to present their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper covers the role of skills and platform engagement within a crowdsourcing platform. The three researchers used data generated from the Purdue IronHacks project. Their methods include using a variety of machine learning models (survival with Kaplan-Meier estimator, K-means &amp;amp; centroids derived from Ward&amp;rsquo;s agglomerative hierarchical clustering) to understand temporal engagement, provile skillsets and engagement, and to build predictive user submission models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elkady, Patel, and Dr. Brunswicker will be presenting research on June 29th between 15.00-16.00 Central European Time. Find more about the program &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm-ci2021.com/program&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on the ACM-Ci website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AOM Best Paper Proceedings for RCODI</title>
      <link>/post/6601-best-paper-award-aom/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/6601-best-paper-award-aom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;www.aom.org&#34;&gt;Academy of Management (AOM)&lt;/a&gt; recently honored Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and her collaborator Dr. Saytam Mukherjee for their research on coordination technology development and innovation in complex organizational settings like Open Source Software (OSS), in which a large number of developers work at distance, at different time zones, and outside of formal employment relationships. They specifically focus on software development in &lt;a href=&#34;www.openstack.com&#34;&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most widely deployed open source cloud software in the world. Their paper with the title &lt;strong&gt;Evolution of Coordination Structures in Open Source Software Development: An Exponential Random Graph Model&lt;/strong&gt; was honored with a Best Paper Proceedings Award of the 81st Annual Meeting of the Academy of
Management (29 July - 4 August 2021). It was judged as one the best accepted papers following a double-blinded review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, Brunswicker &amp;amp; Mukherjee examine how two relational mechanisms - preferential attachment and knowledge similarity - predict the formation of Open-Source Software (OSS) coordination structures as they evolve over time. Drawing upon methods in network science and machine learning, they specify and implement an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*) using data from 619 developers in Nova, OpenStack, working on 2597 Python files between 2012 and 2016. Throughout all evolutionary stages,  the results of the computational model furnish statistical evidence of positive non-linear preferential attachment causing skewed distributions distinct from a power-law. Knowledge similarity has a significantly positive effect but impacts only early stages of coordination. The paper&amp;rsquo;s findings advance the literature on OSS and digital innovation more broadly. The findings also inform practice of coordinating distributed work in software development and other technology-intensive settings more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We need you to hack COVID 2.0</title>
      <link>/post/ih2.0/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-day-youve-been-waiting-for-is-here--the-spring-and-summer-ironhacks-data-science-challenge-is-live-and-society-needs-your-help&#34;&gt;The day you&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for is here – the Spring and Summer IronHacks Data Science Challenge is live, and society needs your help.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vaccines are distributed and society is returning to the norm, data scientists seasoned and new are using the IronHacks platform to make an impact in the community by predicting what the foot traffic at COVID hotspots will be over time. While hacking for social cause over the course of two months, top participants have a shot at winning a share of $1,000 in prizes for developing insightful models policymakers can reference to protect communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict which restaurants in Tippecanoe and Marion counties should expect the highest number of visits as COVID-19 restrictions decrease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use actual data that is updated on a weekly basis to build explanatory and communicable models to help citizens, business owners and policymakers better understand where – and why – social activity is occurring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What prior participants have said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The takeaway from the hackathon was that I could interact with everyone, but the energy was so healthy and holistic in the way things progressed. We wanted to create a societal impact and not just get to the top. You can literally get inspired by other solutions and then try to implement in your own model. This is a better way to go about it.&amp;rdquo; - Dhruvi Shah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The excitement to know how my model would perform after every round kept me enthused till the end! These predictions can give insights into social distancing norms and implement necessary precautions.&amp;rdquo; - Feny Patel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions?&lt;/strong&gt;
Reach out to the IronHacks team &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:d27b1045.groups.purdue.edu@amer.teams.ms&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ironhacks.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ready to hack for social good?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;IronHacks Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helping Hack for Social Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLOS ONE Call for Papers: Cities as Complex Systems</title>
      <link>/post/6536-plos-one-call-for-papers-cities-as-complex-systems/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 19:25:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/6536-plos-one-call-for-papers-cities-as-complex-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cities are centers of human interactions and the innovations that arise from them. Urbanization has led to many positive developments for society, but also contributes to many of our most pressing challenges, from sustainability and climate change to poverty and inequality. Concepts from complex systems and network theory provide valuable approaches to further our understanding of the processes which drive how cities form, grow, and operate as environments which are more than the sum of their parts. With its commitment to open access, and rigorous, reproducible research,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is the ideal venue for interdisciplinary complexity science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our director, an academic editor of PLOS ONE in the area of network science/complex systems is excited to announce a Call for Papers on Cities as Complex Systems, bringing together researchers across scientific disciplines to build a collection of complex systems and networks research applied to questions in urban science. Our Guest Editors Marta González and Diego Rybski are particularly interested in reading research on urban mobility and energy infrastructures, the morphology and efficiency of cities, and applications to sustainable development goals.&lt;em&gt;Topics may include but are not limited to urban mobility and migration, urban scaling laws, social networks within cities, urban resilience, financial networks within and between cities, smart cities and internet-of-things, and agent-based models of urban phenomena. More details can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://collections.plos.org/s/cities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The submission deadline is July 3, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-scholar-assistants-from-colombia-arrived-to-rcodi&#34;&gt;New scholar assistants from Colombia arrived to RCODI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running the last version of The Ironhacks contest at Universidad Nacional de Colombia early this year, Cristian Baquero (left on the picture), winner on the Best Solution category, and Alejandro Díaz (left on the picture), Student ambassador of RCODI at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, arrived at Purdue University to assist the Ironhacks Team on research activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are students of Systems and Computing engineering at Universidad Nacional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time Cristian visit the United States; &amp;ldquo;I am very grateful for the opportunity to be here at Purdue, I hope I can learn from Professor Brunswicker a lot and to experience the culture of this country&amp;rdquo; says Cristian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both students will be at campus till January 6th 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Alejandro, this is the second time he came to the States to assist the team as main software developer. He designed and programed the new version of The Ironhacks Platform, a web application that is used to run programing marathons online, which is the main tool used by the team to gather data. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here to continue the development process with the team, we aim to run a contest around the world with hundreds of people participating at the same time, this is a very ambitious project!&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

UNAL students participated in the Spring 2019 Purdue IronHacks competition and were challenged to create an app to help university students find safe and affordable housing in the New York area. For the first treatment group, José Fernando Morantes Florez, Jhonatan Sandoval Velasco, Juan Pulido won first, second, and third respectively; Cristian Adolfo Baquero Pico, Cristian Alejandro Mantilla Duque, and Julián David Rodríguez Ruíz won first second, and third respectively for the second treatment group. With the support from the National Science Foundation and other partners such as Amazon, Red Hat, and the state of Indiana, Purdue IronHacks has undoubtedly made its impact on the global open data movement. no-repeat;center top;; Professor Nicolás Múnera Garzón, a professor at the UNAL whose students participated in Ironhacks, said he was grateful for the opportunity it provided. no-repeat;center top;; “Purdue IronHacks was a great experience for me as a teacher. Students enrolled in the software engineering class with me didn&amp;rsquo;t only learn about the common approach about crafting software that fulfills all technical requirements, they learned also this real need of delivering for real users,” Garzón said. “I&amp;rsquo;m glad and thankful that we worked with incredible people up there at Purdue. The team was always attentive and supporting making the experience even better, so I take this opportunity just to say, thank you! All of you, Alejandro, Sabine, Sebastian&amp;hellip; All of you who were involved with this initiative!” no-repeat;center top;; The IronHacks team has already received emails asking for Ironhacks to continue one more year. no-repeat;center top;; Below, you can find a testimonial video of our winner, Cristian Aldolfo. no-repeat;center top;; About Ironhacks: IronHacks is an 8-week class that combines active learning and app development with a real-world open data competition. It was designed to make hackers familiar with open data released by federal agencies and corporations. Further, it aims to trigger user-centered design of data-driven interfaces with graphs and maps that support end-user decision making. During the 5-stage iterative virtual competition, students utilize open data to create novel and useful online applications (apps) for citizens in areas such as housing, healthcare, etc. Competing participants have access to tutorials, standardized libraries and packages, and virtual help sessions. While they are engaging in an active learning process, their apps are being evaluated using automated techniques and expert judgement. Real time and targeted feedback accelerate their learning process as well as improve their programing skills and their ability to hack complex problems with open data and open standards. no-repeat;center top;; uA19asPOOos 700 400&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ACM-CHI-2018.jpg&#34;&gt;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ACM-CHI-2018.jpg&lt;/a&gt; At the end of last year, on 20th December 2018, Marlen Promann, a Purdue Independent Interdisciplinary PhD candidate (IIGP) , defended her PhD dissertation proposal wherein she asked normative questions about how social data charts support collective awareness and encourage sustainable action in the personal home context. no-repeat;center top;; Promann is interested in the explosive rise of personal data and how they are visualized to end users, nudging them to change their everyday behaviors. Inspired by Elinor Ostrom and her theory of Collective Action, Promann is passionate about leveraging technologies to empower people to collectively manage societal well-fare. Hence,her dissertation explores how charts that depict social data may encourage cooperation around societal issues like recycling, energy conservation, sustainability, social inclusion, etc. that often present users with social dilemmas about doing good in the long term or benefiting oneself in the short term. Ms. Promann uniquely blends her 10+ years of design experience (BA HonsDesign, 2005) and her social scientific research training(MSc Media and Communications, 2010) to integrate perceptual theories of design with social psychological theories to develop theoretical assumptions about how charts may convey the semantics of ‘socialunity’ that may enhance contributions to group goals. Her controlled perceptual experiments confirmed her first hypotheses that particular visual chart structures can indeed enhance perceptions of group unity;however, she found them to have particular semantic meanings of unity (room for more intriguing research). She is now working on a series of behavioral game experiments to see if such perceptual interpretive differences by chart designs can also lead to variable conservation behaviors. no-repeat;center top;; Her dissertation will make three major contributions to three different fields: (1)Pertinent to the Visualization community, Marlen’s findings highlight the importance of encoding data with appropriate visual structures and cues that support rather than contradict the message of the underlying data and/or the goal of the data feedback. (2)Uniquely to the HCI and design communities, Marlen deep dived into the psychological and perceptual theories to inform her chart designs and to empirically measure the causal effects of her designs on the end users. This empirical rigor is what has long been needed to truly test the many novel ideas that emerge within the HCI and design communities. (3)Despite prior efforts to connect the design (HCI) and behavioral science (environmental psychology, smart buildings, energy, etc.), Marlen’s work is at the forefront of connecting theory driven design with empirical evidence of specific visual cues in a design affecting behavior change. (4)Last, but not least, her efforts to leverage behavioral games to test how visual chart design may prime users to cooperate more in social dilemma situations is new to the present games literature that has largely focused on text based feedback. no-repeat;center top;; If you found this interesting, feel free to check out more about the opportunity that positive nudging can have in &lt;a href=&#34;rcodi.org/nudging&#34;&gt;this article.&lt;/a&gt; no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it be in the way the golden ratio is correlated with growth in shells or how the Pythagorean model is the reason we have stable structures, nature will always hold the key to predicting our own behavior and understanding more about ourselves. It is with this idea that &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/ourpeople&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and Dr. Satyam Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; set off to model dynamics between others in design and collaboration. Using the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=313965&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;motif structures&lt;/a&gt;, something typically used for describing and organizing href=&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824%3Ebiological&#34;&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824&amp;gt;biological&lt;/a&gt; systems, the two analyzed how files are linked instead, gaining insight into the collaborative design of source code. left no-repeat;center top;; When reprogramming and re-purposing a certain design part through modifying source files, each individual splits, augments, and inverts which change design interdependence among a small set of files. With this research, we will be able to understand the micro-level design actions that underpin the evolution of a large design artifact developed in fluid organizational forms like open source collaboration. In there, individuals self-select into tasks and make design decisions using simple heuristics (rather than real-option informed design choices). left no-repeat;center top;; Dr. Mukherjee presented their work at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmadabad this month at the international conference on &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Network Science in Economics and Finance. &lt;/a&gt; left no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

The seemingly impossible task of deactivating your account on a service you no longer use. All of the above are examples of dark design patterns, or “dark UX,” where the design of a website or application is meant to benefit the brand rather than the user—even at the expense of the latter. Dark design patterns are actually a type of digital nudging, creating user-interface in a way that influences the audience’s choices. While being subconsciously influenced by what we use seems frightening, what if we could influence people to do good? left no-repeat;center top;; &lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DpjjZFKX4AE5NQG.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; That is one of the core ideas to Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and Marlen Promann’s research in The Effect of Proximity in Social Data Charts on Perceived Utility. Brunswicker and Promann discuss findings on the dissonance between visual structure and statistical structure, and how its misuse tends to result in misinterpretations. However, when used correctly, visual elements such as charts can actually elicit responses of unity and overcome certain problems such as social loafing—when certain members in a group get benefits from the group’s accomplishments despite not actively contributing like the other members. With this effect, people could be prompted to care more for larger issues that most of us tend to ignore such as sustainability. left no-repeat;center top;; 289787716 700 400 This research has opened the way for future projects on what could be called “white UX”, or design that influences its consumers to become more selfless. Through their work on visual elements and how charts can promote unity among its viewers, they have discovered a new possibility to potentially solving macro-scale social issues. left no-repeat;center top;; If you are interested in learning more, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfW1kkSsGg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; showing a practical application of data visualization, developed as part of the broader NSF grant this research is connected, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/papers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to the IEEE Information Visualization Conference where this work was presented. left no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rcodi-fellowship-fall-2018&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCODI Fellowship Fall 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-i-become-an-rcodi-undergraduate-fellow-for-fall-2018&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I become an RCODI undergraduate fellow for Fall 2018?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our state has a serious workforce problem. There more than 200,000 unfilled jobs and many counties are not taking the right measures to develop the skills of their residents. Do you want to make a change to our state’s workforce problem using data visualization? Become an undergraduate RCODI fellow for Fall 2018 (with a guaranteed stipend for the first 8 weeks) and join a cohort of other 30 to 50 students who want to use their creativity, technical skills, and analytical mind to make an impact on governments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please review the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the information about the fellowship below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the registration form that is at the end of this page or direct link &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apply-here-httpsrcodiorgfellowship-registration-form&#34;&gt;Apply &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-fellowship-structured&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the fellowship structured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is collaborating with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to launch a unique data analytics fellowship program focused on the area of &lt;strong&gt;workforce analytics&lt;/strong&gt;. The fellowship is open for a cohort of undergraduate students enrolled at Purdue University (between 30 to 50 students will be admitted) that go through a two-stage program, including undergraduate research, in which they analyze, visualize and interactively display their results in web-based “app” to be used by policymakers for their decisions on workforce development in the state of Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full program is structured in two phases. Phase 1 includes the 8-week program, in which undergraduate students explore open governmental data as well as workforce data available for the selected fellows only (e.g. skill-level, unfilled jobs, training opportunities). They will analyze, visualize the data, and make them actionable in an interactive web “app” using technologies like HTML, CSS, and D3.js (see cool data visualizations done in D3.js in Figure 1 below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure1_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: D3.js visualizations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to develop an interactive app that is used by the governmental actors and agencies when making important workforce-related decisions. The first phase is set-up as hacking challenge run by RCODI, in which a cohort of 30 to 50 students go through a structured training and tutorial program, and then participate in 5 iterative hacking events, in which they use their creativity to develop novel and useful workforce apps. Depending on performance in the first 8 weeks, Phase 2 includes the opportunity for a longer-term fellowship follow-on for selected top students to deepen their analysis and advance their project further individually or in a small team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase lasts 8 weeks and is structured in distinct phases visualized in the figure below. It starts with pre-training sessions to familiarize participants with technologies (e.g. APIs, D3.js) needed, followed by a 5-stage iterative on-campus competition. During this training period, you will also be familiarized with the DWD data during sessions run by representatives of the state, and a team of data scientists. Fellows will have access to tutorials, live help sessions, a social coding environment, and community features. Automatic hosting of apps, code evaluations, and workflow support for usability judging provides additional assistance to the hackers in agile design and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure2_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Process for phase 1 of the hacking program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training period will start on October 12-14th. The competition portion of the fellowship will take place over 5 weekends in October and November (see below). Students will develop their apps in our lab setting on weekends: &lt;strong&gt;October 19-21&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;October 26-28&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 2-4&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 9-11&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 16-18&lt;/strong&gt;. Meeting times on weekends will be defined in coordination with fellows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-the-candidate-gain-from-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can the candidate gain from the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, the candidates that are chosen to participate will receive a stipend, a certificate of participation, direct interaction with our state’s decisionmakers and other thought leaders in addition to a real working product that can be included in the candidate&amp;rsquo;s digital portfolio for future references. This is on top of the financial “base reward” of $100 for 8 weeks. This base stipend is independent of the performance of the participants. The final financial reward is allocated based on the participants standing in the cohort (below lowest 25% of the participants, better than the lower 25% quartile but worse than 50% of the participants, better than 50% of the fellows but worse than the upper 25%, in the upper 25% quartile). The top 25% can receive a final payment of $800 dollars. The reward depends on how well the fellows score at each stage of the competition in the area of analytics, information visualization, and novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-during-the-first-phase-of-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens during the first phase of the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will tackle a real-world challenge in the area of workforce analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will prepare and analyze open data as well as ‘restricted’ data that are exclusively available for the fellows through the collaboration with DWD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will advance your skills in HTML, CSS, and D3.js during the training session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will use analytical thinking and creativity when exploring, correlating, and visualizing the data in order to respond to the hacking challenge presented to you at the start of the hacking challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will create and test a web-based app that is novel in terms of data visualization (D3.js) and also interactive features. You will also test your prototype in the lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will participate in and experience experimental lab studies using eye-tracking technologies and data science methods (A/B testing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will interact with a team of experts (professors, researchers, representatives of DWD, team members of the chief data scientists of Indiana).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will have the opportunity to present your final outcomes in a presentation to a board of experts consisting of DWD, other policymakers, and Purdue researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your final study will be published as a short whitepaper including a demonstration of your prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds overwhelming? We will be here to support you: There are tutors, mentors, etc. who will help you in this program to ramp up fast. We will have a training period! There will be also free food on weekends and drinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria-for-selection-of-candidates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for selection of candidates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate will need to present proof of the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrolled in a program requiring programming experience (computer science, computer graphics technology, engineering or related areas) or other evidence for prior programming experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence with interest on learning and having experience in developing web applications using HTML/CSS/Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving skills and the ability and willingness to learn new techniques quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in data visualization and data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally also prior experience with Javascript and D3.js, learning and doing cool stuff!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-rcodi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About RCODI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at Purdue University brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars and thinkers focused on the emerging phenomenon of open digital innovation. Open digital innovation encompasses completely new ways we create and use information and data-driven products and services. We design and evaluate data-driven applications and smart technologies to tackle societal challenges such as sustainability, safety, healthy living. Social coding platforms and virtual hacking communities serve as our virtual living labs. Our researchers use advance techniques of computational social science such as behavioral analytics and large-scale online experiments to develop new digital technologies that support humans in the role as citizens, workers, and policymakers in making smarter decisions. As user-inspired researchers, we intensively engage with industry partners, policymakers, and individual citizens. In 2016, RCODI launched Purdue IronHacks, a unique virtual multi-staged open data competition, in which students and innovators develop novel and useful apps to solve societal challenges. More Information about RCODI: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rcodi.org&#34;&gt;www.rcodi.org&lt;/a&gt; and IronHacks: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ironhacks.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.ironhacks.com&lt;/a&gt;. The program is funded by the Science of Science and Innovation Policy Program (SciSPI) of the National Science Foundation (NSF, Award No. #1462044). Dr. Sabine Brunswicker is the founder and director of RCODI, as well as Associate Professor for Digital Innovation at Purdue University. She also acts as a policy advisor in the USA and Europe and has been a keynote speaker at events like World Economic Forum. no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

Do you want to make a change to our state’s workforce problem using data visualization? Become an undergraduate RCODI fellow for Fall 2018 (with a guaranteed stipend for the first 8 weeks) and join a cohort of other 30 to 50 students who want to use their creativity, technical skills, and analytical mind to make an impact on governments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please review the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the information about the fellowship below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the registration form that is at the end of this page or direct link &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apply-here-httpsrcodiorgfellowship-registration-form&#34;&gt;Apply &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-fellowship-structured&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the fellowship structured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is collaborating with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to launch a unique data analytics fellowship program focused on the area of &lt;strong&gt;workforce analytics&lt;/strong&gt;. The fellowship is open for a cohort of undergraduate students enrolled at Purdue University (between 30 to 50 students will be admitted) that go through a two-stage program, including undergraduate research, in which they analyze, visualize and interactively display their results in web-based “app” to be used by policymakers for their decisions on workforce development in the state of Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full program is structured in two phases. Phase 1 includes the 8-week program, in which undergraduate students explore open governmental data as well as workforce data available for the selected fellows only (e.g. skill-level, unfilled jobs, training opportunities). They will analyze, visualize the data, and make them actionable in an interactive web “app” using technologies like HTML, CSS, and D3.js (see cool data visualizations done in D3.js in Figure 1 below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure1_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: D3.js visualizations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to develop an interactive app that is used by the governmental actors and agencies when making important workforce-related decisions. The first phase is set-up as hacking challenge run by RCODI, in which a cohort of 30 to 50 students go through a structured training and tutorial program, and then participate in 5 iterative hacking events, in which they use their creativity to develop novel and useful workforce apps. Depending on performance in the first 8 weeks, Phase 2 includes the opportunity for a longer-term fellowship follow-on for selected top students to deepen their analysis and advance their project further individually or in a small team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase lasts 8 weeks and is structured in distinct phases visualized in the figure below. It starts with pre-training sessions to familiarize participants with technologies (e.g. APIs, D3.js) needed, followed by a 5-stage iterative on-campus competition. During this training period, you will also be familiarized with the DWD data during sessions run by representatives of the state, and a team of data scientists. Fellows will have access to tutorials, live help sessions, a social coding environment, and community features. Automatic hosting of apps, code evaluations, and workflow support for usability judging provides additional assistance to the hackers in agile design and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure2_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Process for phase 1 of the hacking program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training period will start on October 12-14th. The competition portion of the fellowship will take place over 5 weekends in October and November (see below). Students will develop their apps in our lab setting on weekends: &lt;strong&gt;October 19-21&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;October 26-28&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 2-4&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 9-11&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 16-18&lt;/strong&gt;. Meeting times on weekends will be defined in coordination with fellows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-the-candidate-gain-from-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can the candidate gain from the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, the candidates that are chosen to participate will receive a stipend, a certificate of participation, direct interaction with our state’s decisionmakers and other thought leaders in addition to a real working product that can be included in the candidate&amp;rsquo;s digital portfolio for future references. This is on top of the financial “base reward” of $100 for 8 weeks. This base stipend is independent of the performance of the participants. The final financial reward is allocated based on the participants standing in the cohort (below lowest 25% of the participants, better than the lower 25% quartile but worse than 50% of the participants, better than 50% of the fellows but worse than the upper 25%, in the upper 25% quartile). The top 25% can receive a final payment of $800 dollars. The reward depends on how well the fellows score at each stage of the competition in the area of analytics, information visualization, and novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-during-the-first-phase-of-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens during the first phase of the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will tackle a real-world challenge in the area of workforce analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will prepare and analyze open data as well as ‘restricted’ data that are exclusively available for the fellows through the collaboration with DWD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will advance your skills in HTML, CSS, and D3.js during the training session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will use analytical thinking and creativity when exploring, correlating, and visualizing the data in order to respond to the hacking challenge presented to you at the start of the hacking challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will create and test a web-based app that is novel in terms of data visualization (D3.js) and also interactive features. You will also test your prototype in the lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will participate in and experience experimental lab studies using eye-tracking technologies and data science methods (A/B testing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will interact with a team of experts (professors, researchers, representatives of DWD, team members of the chief data scientists of Indiana).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will have the opportunity to present your final outcomes in a presentation to a board of experts consisting of DWD, other policymakers, and Purdue researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your final study will be published as a short whitepaper including a demonstration of your prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds overwhelming? We will be here to support you: There are tutors, mentors, etc. who will help you in this program to ramp up fast. We will have a training period! There will be also free food on weekends and drinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria-for-selection-of-candidates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for selection of candidates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate will need to present proof of the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrolled in a program requiring programming experience (computer science, computer graphics technology, engineering or related areas) or other evidence for prior programming experience&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-rcodi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About RCODI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at Purdue University brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars and thinkers focused on the emerging phenomenon of open digital innovation. Open digital innovation encompasses completely new ways we create and use information and data-driven products and services. We design and evaluate data-driven applications and smart technologies to tackle societal challenges such as sustainability, safety, healthy living. Social coding platforms and virtual hacking communities serve as our virtual living labs. Our researchers use advance techniques of computational social science such as behavioral analytics and large-scale online experiments to develop new digital technologies that support humans in the role as citizens, workers, and policymakers in making smarter decisions. As user-inspired researchers, we intensively engage with industry partners, policymakers, and individual citizens. In 2016, RCODI launched Purdue IronHacks, a unique virtual multi-staged open data competition, in which students and innovators develop novel and useful apps to solve societal challenges. More Information about RCODI: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rcodi.org&#34;&gt;www.rcodi.org&lt;/a&gt; and IronHacks: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ironhacks.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.ironhacks.com&lt;/a&gt;. The program is funded by the Science of Science and Innovation Policy Program (SciSPI) of the National Science Foundation (NSF, Award No. #1462044). Dr. Sabine Brunswicker is the founder and director of RCODI, as well as Associate Professor for Digital Innovation at Purdue University. She also acts as a policy advisor in the USA and Europe and has been a keynote speaker at events like World Economic Forum. no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RCODI held an IronHacks Awards Ceremony to recognize the amazing work accomplished by 27 Purdue students.
On Monday December 4, 2017, RCODI held an IronHacks Awards Ceremony to recognize the amazing work accomplished by 27 students across Purdue campus of creating an app that would solve the civic challenge of “Find me a safe and affordable place to rent near New York University – Stern School of Business.” Purdue IronHackers were greeted and congratulated by our special guests, Mayor John Dennis, West Lafayette, Robert F. Cox, Ph.D, Professor and Senior Associate Dean for Purdue Globalization, Brendan O Connor, Assistant Chief of Staff of the Management Performance Hub (MPH), and Sabine Brunswicker, PhD, Professor, Director of Purdue’s  Research Center for Open Digital Innovation, and the creator of IronHacks. And the top 3 winners were… EMILY KO: Best Community Spirit (contributed the most to the forum) JORDAN LOESER: Best Winning Spirit (performed in the top 25% of each round) JUSTIN MAMARIL: Best Solution (contributed the most to the forum) While these winners walked off with winning certificates, Amazon gift cards valued up to $500, internship possibilities with key sponsors including RedHat, Socrata, and MPH, the chance to go to La Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota where Purdue IronHacks is also established for an internship, and so much more, all the students received cool swag and participant certificates. IronHacks is an exciting software coding program that is offered each semester. So, register today! for next Spring 2018 IronHacks class: Tech499. Though the highlight of the ceremony was the awarding of the top 3 winners, Dr. Robert F. Cox reminded all the students that even though they might not have won, all are winners because “We’re all Boilermakers!” Boiler up! Congratulations to all! no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It marked one and a half year since I got to know Professor Sabine. Today is a special day as I won the battle with my fought with leukemia. When my condition worsened in earlier April, she stepped in quickly to complete the tasks that I was supposed to do. I am forever grateful. Professor Sabine has been the light of my life and a reminder to be positive, motivated and happy in life when I was struggling in between the boundary of life and death. Multiple messages from her asking if I was okay during my procedures, which touched my heart deeply. I would like to dedicate this post to her for her compassion and positive spirit that she has injected into my soul. She is not only a professor, but a lifelong mentor and adviser. This post is written with sincerity and gratefulness by Jay (Student in the School of Engineering, Purdue University)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our very own Master’s Student, Charles Song and his team placed 2nd last weekend in the first “Internet of Things Civic Hackathon” in Fishers, Indiana, run by AT&amp;amp;T and Code for America’s Indiana branch, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openindybrigade.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Indy Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. Using local open data to code mobile apps and hack hardware solutions to help better their community, Charles and his team developed a web application to predict crime in Indianapolis based on 911 dialing records from the Indianapolis Police. Charles was pleased with the outcome and said about the application: “Moving to a new area and picking the best place to live is a monumental decision for anybody and we wanted to make this decision easier for the citizen. Crime can tell you a lot about an area in terms of safety and comfort and this is the first step towards helping future Indianapolis citizens to feel safe in this fantastic city”. Congratulations, Charles and team, for your great effort and 2nd place!&lt;/p&gt;

We thank the ABE Graduate Student Association for putting together a great event and look forward to the bright future of data-driven agriculture. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7407.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7407-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_7407&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7399.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7399-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_7399&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7387.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7387-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_7387&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Takeshi is a second year Master’s student in the Graduate School of Business &amp;amp; Commerce, Keio University, Japan. His research  focuses on relations between open innovation and organizational features (e.g. organizational culture, organizational capabilities or organizational structures). &lt;em&gt;” Right now, I’m researching about contributing factors in Japanese organizations when adopting technologies outside with conventional organizational theories”&lt;/em&gt;, Takeshi says. The visit will be for a week this year, but he plans to come back for one of the prime open innovation hubs in the US: &lt;em&gt;“I’m planning to stay at the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation in 2017 with help by the Keio Program for Leading Graduate School (PLGS) and I am very excited for this opportunity”&lt;/em&gt;, Takeshi says. We at RCODI will be looking forward to having him on our team in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DR. BRUNSWICKER TO CHAIR SPECIAL SESSION AT R&amp;D MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE 2014</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sabine Brunswicker of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation will be chairing a special session focused on the topic of “Open Strategizing in R&amp;amp;D” as a brief description of what will be discussed at the special session please see below: In recent years there has been an increasing interest in “open strategy” among academics and practitioners. The term “open strategy” suggests that openness does not only relate to managing openness in an individual R&amp;amp;D project or in the idea-to-launch process. Open strategizing implies a more open approach towards managing the strategy and policy processes. Open strategy as a process is emerging in private firms which open up their corporate R&amp;amp;D strategy processes. In addition, public organizations emphasize openness when developing strategies and policies. Openness in strategy processes may appear in many different forms, such as the integration of a large number of internal employees. In addition, there are open strategy processes where organizations engage with external stakeholders to co-create novel strategic ideas for emerging strategic areas. In some cases, open strategy making is more concerned with communication to the public. Participatory strategy processes regularly making use of IT (e.g. crowdsourcing platforms) which affords novel ways to engage a large number of participants. There are two key dimensions that characterize open strategy making, namely (1) greater internal and external transparency as well as (2) greater inclusiveness of various actors in strategy-making, internal and external. Greater openness on these dimensions is clearly opposed to conventional notions of strategy which treat it as exclusive and secretive rather than inclusive and transparent. Information systems may both afford or constrain openness in strategy processes.

      <title>CALL FOR PAPERS: OPEN STRATEGY: TOWARDS MORE OPENNESS IN STRATEGY PROCESSES IN R&amp;D</title>
      <link>/post/3480-call-for-papers-open-strategy-towards-more-openness-in-strategy-processes-in-rd/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2014 00:00:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/3480-call-for-papers-open-strategy-towards-more-openness-in-strategy-processes-in-rd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years there has been an increasing interest in “open strategy” among academics and practitioners. The term “open strategy” suggests that openness does not only relate to managing openness in an individual R&amp;amp;D project or in the idea-to-launch process. Open strategizing implies a more open approach towards managing the strategy and policy processes. Open strategy as a process is emerging in private firms which open up their corporate R&amp;amp;D strategy processes. In addition, public organizations emphasize openness when developing strategies and policies. Openness in strategy processes may appear in many different forms, such as the integration of a large number of internal employees. In addition, there are open strategy processes where organizations engage with external stakeholders to co-create novel strategic ideas for emerging strategic areas. In some cases, open strategy making is more concerned with communication to the public. Participatory strategy processes regularly making use of IT (e.g. crowdsourcing platforms) which affords novel ways to engage a large number of participants. There are two key dimensions that characterize open strategy making, namely (1) greater internal and external &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; as well as (2) greater &lt;em&gt;inclusiveness&lt;/em&gt; of various actors in strategy-making, internal and external. Greater openness on these dimensions is clearly opposed to conventional notions of strategy which treat it as exclusive and secretive rather than inclusive and transparent. Information systems may both &lt;em&gt;afford&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;constrain&lt;/em&gt; openness in strategy processes. With this special session we call for papers that tackle open strategy in R&amp;amp;D and the strategic use of information systems in open strategy in R&amp;amp;D from different perspectives and theoretical lenses (e.g. network theory, micro-political approaches, theory of affordances). We are interested in advancing existing theory and strongly encourage empirical contributions that span both the private as well as the public sector.

      <guid>/post/3474-new-paper-on-open-innovation-in-smes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sabine Brunswicker and Wim Vanhaverbeke recently authored a paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Small Business Management&lt;/em&gt; on external knowledge sourcing, a form of inbound open innovation in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Earlier work on SMEs indicates that by nature, innovation in such firms has an external focus and is often strongly embedded in social and personal ties. However, the literature also has many gaps. This paper discusses how SMEs purposively source external knowledge in innovation as well as the role of integrative managerial practices for innovation in external knowledge sourcing. &lt;a href=&#34;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2351047&#34; title=&#34;Abstract/Download&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Read more at SSRN »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/3468-new-report-examines-how-large-companies-practice-open-innovation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sabine Brunswicker and Henry Chesbrough have conducted the first large-sample survey of open innovation adoption among large companies. Their study of European and U.S. companies gives an extensive overview of the ways that companies are now practicing open innovation, along with the trends that can be discerned. The results show that large companies consider open innovation to be very important and are expecting it to grow even further. The biggest challenge, however, lies within the organization: managing the journey from closed to open innovation by setting up new structures, processes and responsibilities. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en/business-areas/technology-innovation-management/1060-open-innovation-a-fad-or-a-phenomenon.html&#34; title=&#34;Read More&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Read more at Fraunhofer »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
