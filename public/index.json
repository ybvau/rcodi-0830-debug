They specifically focus on software development in OpenStack, one of the most widely deployed open source cloud software in the world. Their paper with the title Evolution of Coordination Structures in Open Source Software Development: An Exponential Random Graph Model was honored with a Best Paper Proceedings Award of the 81st Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management (29 July - 4 August 2021). It was judged as one the best accepted papers following a double-blinded review process.\nIn this paper, Brunswicker \u0026amp; Mukherjee examine how two relational mechanisms - preferential attachment and knowledge similarity - predict the formation of Open-Source Software (OSS) coordination structures as they evolve over time. Drawing upon methods in network science and machine learning, they specify and implement an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*) using data from 619 developers in Nova, OpenStack, working on 2597 Python files between 2012 and 2016. Throughout all evolutionary stages, the results of the computational model furnish statistical evidence of positive non-linear preferential attachment causing skewed distributions distinct from a power-law. Knowledge similarity has a significantly positive effect but impacts only early stages of coordination. The paper\u0026rsquo;s findings advance the literature on OSS and digital innovation more broadly. The findings also inform practice of coordinating distributed work in software development and other technology-intensive settings more broadly.\n  ","date":1622073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622177762,"objectID":"19cbf8ae331be7d395599540a3d86643","permalink":"/post/6601-best-paper-award-aom/","publishdate":"2021-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/6601-best-paper-award-aom/","section":"post","summary":"The Academy of Management (AOM) recently honored Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and her collaborator Dr. Saytam Mukherjee for their research on coordination technology development and innovation in complex organizational settings like Open Source Software (OSS), in which a large number of developers work at distance, at different time zones, and outside of formal employment relationships.","tags":["Open Source","Research"],"title":"AOM Best Paper Proceedings for RCODI","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A new member joined the team!

Science has shown that music can bond people together and motivate them to act collectively. What if during this time of potential ecological and societal collapse, we can use the potential of music to save our future? What if music could trigger social tipping points, thresholds at which the actions of a few artists and their fan base engage the masses to act actively in order to realize social change?\nAnd there are young artists who want their art to go beyond “feel good music” and inspire meaningful actions from and with their followers. However, popular metrics such as Billboard Top 100 do not give them sufficient capacity for their songs to become a Call to Action.\nWe, the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) and its members and fellows, have joined forces with the EARTHwise Centre to change this.\nOUR VISION: Every artist should have access to a community platform to co-create songs that ignite collective action for a thrivable world.\n For whom is it? Our digital platform connects three key actors to co-create a playlist of songs that call a global audience to take action for social change.\n Artists (musicians, cultural creatives) who co-create songs throughout an iterative process Advisors (experts in “thrivability” focused not only on sustainability but also social and human capital to regenerate planetary, social, cognitive as well as spiritual resources) who advise artists in defining their call for action Listeners (you, me, and people around the world) who help artists to learn about the potential of their lyrics and sounds to motivate others to follow their call for action   The key features The community platform offers artists a range of novel features to create songs that ignite action:\n OUR SONGS: Access to the community’s co-created songs prior to the global release of the tipping point playlist (e.g. via Spotify) MY STUDIO: A space to create and upload different versions of an artist’s song (its audio, its narrative) with features to implement the song’s call for actions (e.g. donations related to the song) MY RESULTS: Access to feedback from advisors and listeners as well as access to song analytics (e.g. “danceability”, listener engagement) MY SOCIAL NETWORK: Access to a discussion forum to engage in the dialogue with like-minded artists who want to thrive MY LAB: Tools and tutorials to learn about digital music production, “thrivability,” and more   The benefits for artists  Join a community of creatives for social change Co-create a song that calls for action Select a curated global initiatives (e.g. charity or fund) to implement your song’s call for action Have your song featured in the Tipping Point channels and playlists  The research and tech development Our interdisciplinary team of scientists, designers, artists, and platform engineers (more detailshere) can build upon several years of scientific research and practical development experiences on how to design digital platforms for co-creation and collective action. We have worked with thousands of individuals and hackers around the world to scientifically validate platform features, incentive systems, social technologies, and interface designs for co-creation. Such efforts were supported by the National Science Foundation and donations from industry leaders who are convinced that digital technologies can democratize innovation.\nIn the next few months, we build upon these foundations to design and built the first version of the tipping point community platform. It will use state of the art of web technologies (MERN stack), data science techniques, and AI models (e.g. natural language processing, deep learning, network analytics, agent-based modeling). Our goal is to launch it in summer/fall 2020 along with a global call for the music for social change challenge. This platform will also be the foundation of a multi-year research program focused on the 1) role of music for collective action, 2) the nature of social tipping points in the context of thrivability, and 3) the constituting tole of digital technologies and information design for enabling collective action. You can learn more about the research program here.\n Our intended impact Our goal is that with the launch of a music for social change challenge in fall 2020, we can make impact and:\n Involve thousands of artists in the co-creation challenge Create and release a final Spotify playlist with 100 songs calling for collective action across multiple dimensions of social change (e.g. related to different sustainability development goals of the United Nations) Develop new sound and text analytics features (based on machine and deep learning methods) measuring the the latent properties of songs that explains the songs’ potential to enable coherent actions for social change Use the platform as a “living lab” to understand what features of the platform can unify the emotions and actions of thousands of people (despite their geographic, cultural, and social differences) Enable and predict social tipping points – thresholds at which songs become viral and motivate the masses to take actions for the social good   Support our vision RCODI and the EARTHwise Centre calls for your support to make this vision reality. Every donation counts so that we can launch the global music for social change challenge soon. Visit earthwisecentre.org/music-for-change to support our efforts to use science and music to transform our future.\nJoin people around the world and create Your Song of Action. Creating actionable lyrics, melodies, and songs for regenerating Mother Earth and co-creating a world that works for all.\nFor more information visit earthwisecentre.org/music-for-change\n ","date":1581272652,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619302265,"objectID":"3807509bf95d64b1562c66a616192224","permalink":"/project/music-challenge-for-social-change/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T18:24:12Z","relpermalink":"/project/music-challenge-for-social-change/","section":"project","summary":"The Tipping Point Community Platform for a “Music for Social Change” Challenge Powered by RCODI IronHacks\nWhy do we need it?

Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey of 187 managers responsible for an OI project, the authors use theory on behavioral-based control mechanisms to explore whether the effect of external knowledge search breadth and depth on OI performance is contingent on having the right levels of control mechanisms in place. Findings The results showed that the control mechanism mediates the relationship between external knowledge search breadth and depth and OI project performance. Furthermore, project complexity is an important moderator of these effects, especially for outcome control. Originality/value A better OI project’s performance is not achieved by external knowledge search breadth and depth alone, but by building process and outcome control mechanism on it to balance knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Furthermore, Outcome control is only helpful with less complex OI projects.","tags":["Innovation performance","Control mechanism","Knowledge search breadth and depth","Oi project","Process/outcome control","Project complexity"],"title":"Knowledge search breadth and depth and OI projects performance: a moderated mediation model of control mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Michael Prietula"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"d16c6a5e9f8a3afd7f600366ea856e8d","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-upside-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:50.699365Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-upside-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Upside of Strategic Misalignment: The Interplay between Platform Transparency and Developers’ Design Strategy on Open Digital Platforms for Innovation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Satyam Mukherjee"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"0c4dc3a9219cdfa3069d63169ce66c29","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-microstructure-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:19.591111Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-microstructure-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The established stream of literature on design architectures argues that designers should aim for modular architecture in order increase the system’s technical performance by lowering the propagation costs of the system’s design: A system with a small stable “core”, a cycle of coupled parts of the system, and a large variable periphery reduce the risk of technical feature and increase opportunity for innovation. However, such a core-periphery view ignores the micro-level dependency structures that emerge in open collaboration when a large number of developers produce a complex technical system at distance, virtually, and outside of formal employment relationships. In this paper, we develop a theory of design network motifs that accounts for the smallest design dependencies in the system that emerge in situ. Informed by the network theoretical concept of a “motif”, we introduce design motifs as the smallest unit of design interdependencies in a system architecture and develop a theory of design network motifs describe each system’s ‘motif fingerprint’ and explains how certain motif patterns affect the performance of a system as a whole. We empirically examine our design network motif theory using architectural data of the Open Stack repository NOVA, consisting of 2359 files and 1545532 lines of code. We extract all potential design network motifs created by 872 developers for 5 years. Our results show that design network motifs offer a new way to explain hidden dependencies in complex system architectures.

The recent literature on digital innovation suggests that open platforms, which encourage their developers to build upon each other's knowledge when innovating their add-on apps in the periphery, face a related paradox. Developers face the tension of either being coherent with the past, or flexible to adjust to the future. In this paper, we examine how the trade-off between coherent and flexible search mechanisms affects the individual developer's choice of innovating a certain app as well as his or her cumulative impact, i.e., the degree of modifications to the app. We study an open platform in the multi-disciplinary field of nanotechnology, in which 480 developers perform more than 30,000 problem-solving actions over a period of 10 years. We use relational event modeling to differentially assess the effect of the coherent and flexible search strategies. We find that developers are significantly more likely to choose a certain app that is consistent with both a coherent and flexible strategy. However, a coherent strategy leads to greater cumulative impact on an app compared to a strategy of being mutually coherent and flexible. Thus, our findings indicate both a complementary and a contradictory logic in how the tension between coherence and flexibility unfolds. We make contributions to the recent literature on digital innovation as well as the innovation literature more broadly. Further, our results inform innovation policy and platform design.","tags":[],"title":"Coherence or flexibility?

It was designed to make hackers familiar with open data released by federal agencies and corporations. Further, it aims to trigger user-centered design of data-driven interfaces with graphs and maps that support end-user decision making. During the 5-stage iterative virtual competition, students utilize open data to create novel and useful online applications (apps) for citizens in areas such as housing, healthcare, etc. Competing participants have access to tutorials, standardized libraries and packages, and virtual help sessions. While they are engaging in an active learning process, their apps are being evaluated using automated techniques and expert judgement. Real time and targeted feedback accelerate their learning process as well as improve their programing skills and their ability to hack complex problems with open data and open standards. no-repeat;center top;; uA19asPOOos 700 400\n","date":1553728246,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614032721,"objectID":"aa3cb81153ba8e4f5b778b8e487e7ed4","permalink":"/post/5896-ironhacks-2019/","publishdate":"2019-03-27T23:10:46Z","relpermalink":"/post/5896-ironhacks-2019/","section":"post","summary":"https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/69C73358-1DD8-42E7-88CB-64EF7012846D.jpg UNAL Students pose for a picture at the awards ceremony https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6EEA0899-6AEB-451A-94D5-41DDFD6706C0.jpg Ironhacks staff Alejandro Vecchio poses with award winners.

Inspired by Elinor Ostrom and her theory of Collective Action, Promann is passionate about leveraging technologies to empower people to collectively manage societal well-fare. Hence,her dissertation explores how charts that depict social data may encourage cooperation around societal issues like recycling, energy conservation, sustainability, social inclusion, etc. that often present users with social dilemmas about doing good in the long term or benefiting oneself in the short term. Ms. Promann uniquely blends her 10+ years of design experience (BA HonsDesign, 2005) and her social scientific research training(MSc Media and Communications, 2010) to integrate perceptual theories of design with social psychological theories to develop theoretical assumptions about how charts may convey the semantics of ‘socialunity’ that may enhance contributions to group goals. Her controlled perceptual experiments confirmed her first hypotheses that particular visual chart structures can indeed enhance perceptions of group unity;however, she found them to have particular semantic meanings of unity (room for more intriguing research). She is now working on a series of behavioral game experiments to see if such perceptual interpretive differences by chart designs can also lead to variable conservation behaviors. no-repeat;center top;; Her dissertation will make three major contributions to three different fields: (1)Pertinent to the Visualization community, Marlen’s findings highlight the importance of encoding data with appropriate visual structures and cues that support rather than contradict the message of the underlying data and/or the goal of the data feedback. (2)Uniquely to the HCI and design communities, Marlen deep dived into the psychological and perceptual theories to inform her chart designs and to empirically measure the causal effects of her designs on the end users. This empirical rigor is what has long been needed to truly test the many novel ideas that emerge within the HCI and design communities. (3)Despite prior efforts to connect the design (HCI) and behavioral science (environmental psychology, smart buildings, energy, etc.), Marlen’s work is at the forefront of connecting theory driven design with empirical evidence of specific visual cues in a design affecting behavior change. (4)Last, but not least, her efforts to leverage behavioral games to test how visual chart design may prime users to cooperate more in social dilemma situations is new to the present games literature that has largely focused on text based feedback. no-repeat;center top;; If you found this interesting, feel free to check out more about the opportunity that positive nudging can have in this article. no-repeat;center top;;\n","date":1548969502,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614032721,"objectID":"23cbd109372cfde0f81ce88c771af4af","permalink":"/post/5855-phd-candidate-marlen-promann-successfully-defends-dissertation-proposal/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T21:18:22Z","relpermalink":"/post/5855-phd-candidate-marlen-promann-successfully-defends-dissertation-proposal/","section":"post","summary":"https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ACM-CHI-2018.jpg At the end of last year, on 20th December 2018, Marlen Promann, a Purdue Independent Interdisciplinary PhD candidate (IIGP) , defended her PhD dissertation proposal wherein she asked normative questions about how social data charts support collective awareness and encourage sustainable action in the personal home context.","tags":[],"title":"PhD Candidate Marlen Promann Successfully Defends Dissertation Proposal","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course Objectives This course provides the foundation for understanding the manner in which companies capture innovation and use it to set themselves apart from competitors.

We explore an assumption of research and practice: that a platform’s architecture needs to be decoupled so that producers can easily mix and match the platform’s design elements (APIs, code libraries, process models, etc.) into apps that perform well competitively, and insulate the platform from skewed outcomes and low market performance. However, in practice, complete decoupling is not just difficult but almost impossible. Based on more than two million runs of an exploratory NK model in which producers use a platform’s design space for the creation of apps, we generate several surprising insights. First, we show that tighter coupling may not necessarily be harmful depending on the producers’ design strategies and the amount of constraints placed on design elements. Second, we observe that if moderate to tightly coupled platforms with optimizing producers focused exclusively on being competitive, platform performance is lower compared to platforms with satisficing producers who put a lower priority of being competitive because of other interests. This is surprising since optimizers are better suited to cope with the inherent uncertainty of coupling. Finally, moderately coupled platforms can outperform platforms with loose coupling when constraints nudge producers into distant design moves while also isolating them from downside uncertainty. These three findings offer implications for multiple streams of literature on platform architectures.","tags":["Loose coupling","Platform architecture","Platforms","Apps","Design strategy","Modular systems","Nk model","Simulation","Software design"],"title":"Optimizing and Satisficing: The Interplay Between Platform Architecture and Producers’ Design Strategies for Platform Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Research Center for Open Digital Innovation RCODI"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"caab126c30529076fe9137afabf731fb","permalink":"/publication/research-center-for-open-digital-innovation-rcodi-purdue-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:18.737757Z","relpermalink":"/publication/research-center-for-open-digital-innovation-rcodi-purdue-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Purdue IronHacks winners 2019","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Waldemar Kremser","Sabine Brunswicker","Brian Pentland"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"2abba68bb6cb5355346638a9538954b1","permalink":"/publication/kremser-continuous-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:52.287526Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kremser-continuous-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Continuous Transformation of Interdependence in Networks of Routines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Laia Pujol Priego","Esteve Almirall"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"3acd8296d3f4bb3d98a1f2b322e3e48d","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-transparency-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:56.91583Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-transparency-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Transparency in public policy: A complexity view","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["biology","influence","news","psychology","research","sabine-brunswicker","satyam-mukherjee","stuctural-motif","visual-data","visualization"],"content":"Everything in life can be connected to a pattern.

Inspired by the eminent neural conversational model built by Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le in Cornell University, we incorporated the ‘sequence to sequence’ model when training our coding bot. Exploiting properties of neural nets, our new approach provides guarantees on the accuracy of the results as neural nets don’t analyze text, which is the functions wrote by programmers, at face value unlike the traditional approach that dissects the texts into smaller tokens, counts the number of times each token shows up and utilizes the ‘bag of words’ model, which is commonly called the ‘dictionary’ to compute the overall subjectivity of the text with the subjectivity of each word pre-recorded. Our new approach, however, will train the classifier and the given new function will be classified in a different category. Based on the theory of ‘sequence to sequence’ model, I will introduce the concept of representing different recurrent neural network in function predictions with different sets of parameters each, where the function is given few data points to learn from the hidden previous function and also the current function. Our model not only learns from the data injected by programmers but how it learns before. When predicting sequences of functions by converting text to vector or numerical representations, we not only predict based on the previous functions but all the functions that came before it by estimating the probability of certain contexts and learning a similarity function where the reply to the programmer is one of the elements in a predefined pool of possible answers. This ability to mimic programmers’ thoughts lead to a more efficient coding process where programmers just have to describe what they want to do to the coding bot to have the relevant functions inserted for them into their software applications.","tags":[],"title":"A Lucky Catch: How a Coding Bot Built with Neural Nets Catch Programmers’ Thoughts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jia Lin Cheoh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"fac981a0a63ffea079241105c5299708","permalink":"/publication/cheoh-ironhacks-2018/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:48.57604Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cheoh-ironhacks-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"New IronHacks software is developed as a tool for running multiphase hackathons, which is also the first tool developed to run hackathons in a tightly controlled environment.

Do you want to make a change to our state’s workforce problem using data visualization? Become an undergraduate RCODI fellow for Fall 2018 (with a guaranteed stipend for the first 8 weeks) and join a cohort of other 30 to 50 students who want to use their creativity, technical skills, and analytical mind to make an impact on governments!\nPlease review the following steps:\n Read the information about the fellowship below. Complete the registration form that is at the end of this page or direct link here  Apply here How is the fellowship structured? The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is collaborating with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to launch a unique data analytics fellowship program focused on the area of workforce analytics. The fellowship is open for a cohort of undergraduate students enrolled at Purdue University (between 30 to 50 students will be admitted) that go through a two-stage program, including undergraduate research, in which they analyze, visualize and interactively display their results in web-based “app” to be used by policymakers for their decisions on workforce development in the state of Indiana.\nThe full program is structured in two phases. Phase 1 includes the 8-week program, in which undergraduate students explore open governmental data as well as workforce data available for the selected fellows only (e.g. skill-level, unfilled jobs, training opportunities). They will analyze, visualize the data, and make them actionable in an interactive web “app” using technologies like HTML, CSS, and D3.js (see cool data visualizations done in D3.js in Figure 1 below).\nFigure 1: D3.js visualizations (https://d3js.org/)\nThe goal is to develop an interactive app that is used by the governmental actors and agencies when making important workforce-related decisions. The first phase is set-up as hacking challenge run by RCODI, in which a cohort of 30 to 50 students go through a structured training and tutorial program, and then participate in 5 iterative hacking events, in which they use their creativity to develop novel and useful workforce apps. Depending on performance in the first 8 weeks, Phase 2 includes the opportunity for a longer-term fellowship follow-on for selected top students to deepen their analysis and advance their project further individually or in a small team setting.\nThe first phase lasts 8 weeks and is structured in distinct phases visualized in the figure below. It starts with pre-training sessions to familiarize participants with technologies (e.g. APIs, D3.js) needed, followed by a 5-stage iterative on-campus competition. During this training period, you will also be familiarized with the DWD data during sessions run by representatives of the state, and a team of data scientists. Fellows will have access to tutorials, live help sessions, a social coding environment, and community features. Automatic hosting of apps, code evaluations, and workflow support for usability judging provides additional assistance to the hackers in agile design and prototyping.\nFigure 2: Process for phase 1 of the hacking program.\nThe training period will start on October 12-14th. The competition portion of the fellowship will take place over 5 weekends in October and November (see below). Students will develop their apps in our lab setting on weekends: October 19-21, October 26-28, November 2-4, November 9-11, November 16-18. Meeting times on weekends will be defined in coordination with fellows!\nWhat can the candidate gain from the fellowship? As part of the program, the candidates that are chosen to participate will receive a stipend, a certificate of participation, direct interaction with our state’s decisionmakers and other thought leaders in addition to a real working product that can be included in the candidate\u0026rsquo;s digital portfolio for future references. This is on top of the financial “base reward” of $100 for 8 weeks. This base stipend is independent of the performance of the participants. The final financial reward is allocated based on the participants standing in the cohort (below lowest 25% of the participants, better than the lower 25% quartile but worse than 50% of the participants, better than 50% of the fellows but worse than the upper 25%, in the upper 25% quartile). The top 25% can receive a final payment of $800 dollars. The reward depends on how well the fellows score at each stage of the competition in the area of analytics, information visualization, and novelty.\nWhat happens during the first phase of the fellowship?  You will tackle a real-world challenge in the area of workforce analytics You will prepare and analyze open data as well as ‘restricted’ data that are exclusively available for the fellows through the collaboration with DWD. You will advance your skills in HTML, CSS, and D3.js during the training session You will use analytical thinking and creativity when exploring, correlating, and visualizing the data in order to respond to the hacking challenge presented to you at the start of the hacking challenge. You will create and test a web-based app that is novel in terms of data visualization (D3.js) and also interactive features. You will also test your prototype in the lab. You will participate in and experience experimental lab studies using eye-tracking technologies and data science methods (A/B testing). You will interact with a team of experts (professors, researchers, representatives of DWD, team members of the chief data scientists of Indiana). You will have the opportunity to present your final outcomes in a presentation to a board of experts consisting of DWD, other policymakers, and Purdue researchers. Your final study will be published as a short whitepaper including a demonstration of your prototype.  Sounds overwhelming? We will be here to support you: There are tutors, mentors, etc. who will help you in this program to ramp up fast. We will have a training period! There will be also free food on weekends and drinks!\nCriteria for selection of candidates: The candidate will need to present proof of the following requirements:\n Enrolled in a program requiring programming experience (computer science, computer graphics technology, engineering or related areas) or other evidence for prior programming experience Evidence with interest on learning and having experience in developing web applications using HTML/CSS/Javascript Problem-solving skills and the ability and willingness to learn new techniques quickly Interest in data visualization and data analysis Ideally also prior experience with Javascript and D3.js, learning and doing cool stuff!!!

As part of this initiative, Data.gov was launched and now contains over 160,000 datasets, free to the public to use. Thus, the open data definition reads:\n\u0026ldquo;Open data is data that anyone can access, use, and share\u0026rdquo; (Open Data Institute)\n…and THAT\u0026rsquo;S what the Purdue IronHacks are all about: Using open data to create something novel!\nIronHacks: Hacking for real world impact! To foster the adoption of open governmental data, federal agencies and cities make use of contests and competitive crowds to spur innovation in the hopes of creating applications that create value for the market. However, such contests often fail to tap into the collective knowledge of the hackers crowd, provide little feedback that guides hackers in creating useful applications, and support little re-use of knowledge about useful features, successful algorithms, that can be integrated and remixed in novel ways.\nStarting Fall 2015, The Purdue Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) will launch a new groundbreaking area of research geared towards helping the design of successful idea competitions so that these can more efficiently spur innovation for a higher economic and social welfare at the regional, national, and global scale. With a focus on transparency rather than just participation as a means to foster innovation, The RCODI will run a series of 3-weeks open data hacks, the Purdue \u0026lsquo;IronHacks\u0026rsquo;, that aim to spur civic innovations. The project is focused on the role of transparency as mechanism to spur innovation among that hackers and create open data solutions that are actually used.\nThe IronHacks In joint collaboration with several Open Data organizations, experts, Purdue Hackers and local city councils, and supported by\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF), The RCODI will engage over 400 students in 4 IronHacks over 2 years in using open datasets from Data.gov and local governmental datasets from Lafayette and West Lafayette, Indiana. Using these datasets and under the mentorship of skilled technical evangelists the students will combine and recombine various types of data to develop unique and novel solutions that meet performance goals in terms of market demand, technological demand, and usability.\nThe IronHacks represent the true spirit of Purdue: working arduously to solve pressing problems that change the world. With this series of hacks, The RCODI will advance research on how we can better use open data and turn them into novel and useful applications. Furthermore, it will provide guidance for better designing hacks and contests for the generation of novel solutions to pressing issues on a regional, national, and global scale.\nBe part of the movement! You love coding, you love getting better at coding, you do not see obstacles but possibilities, and you wish to make a change in society. If you think just one of these criteria fit, you are eligible to compete in the four IronHacks! Joining fellow peers in an inspiring and competitive environment and under the guidance of leading technical experts in Open Data, you will apply theoretical learnings from Purdue and improve on your coding skills in a hectic environment.

Yet, the dominantly individualist data presentation perspectives utilized in current feedback systems have failed to leverage social behavioral theories to design technologically mediated feedback that could enhance individuals' awareness of and their willingness to cooperate with the digitally interconnected others.\nThe ENERGYVIS Project was created to gain deeper insight into how the visual structure of a data graph affects the interpretation and comprehension of the data the chart represents and how they might nudge us to more cooperative choices. Little research has examined the role data visualization design plays in shaping behavior in the context of collective action (e.g., recycling, energy conservation, public protest, juries or organizational committees) that require cooperation and pooling of efforts of individual members, often on a voluntary basis. In such dilemmas, everybody is better off if individuals align with the group goal; however, these tasks typically fail because many do not align with the group\u0026rsquo;s goal. In addition to visual encoding patterns to enhance individuals' social awareness and cooperation, this project will offer resources for new cognitive and perceptual experiments.\nProducts and Contributions: 1 home energy monitoring app.\n1 set of unifying design patterns.\n1 new infovis game model.\n10s of new D3.js graphs.\n10s of behavioral games.\n10s of lab studies.\n100s of on Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.\nData: 100s of annotations.\n100s of perceived group unity measurements.\n1,000s of graph descriptions.\n1,000s of graph based decisions\n10,000 of eye fixations\n10,000s of code lines( see our Github)\nRequest our data\nOur Experiments Research has shown that data based feedback has the potential to make people more aware and cognizant of their synergy decisions. What is lacking is the consideration of the subtle ways in which design details of data based charts frame how people perceive, understand and act in response to the feedback charts.\nWe extend visual perception theory by borrowing from group identity literature, which suggests that perceiving a unified group is required for group alignment and continued commitment. So, we hypothesize that seeing and identifying with a perceivably unified group can sustain users' energy conservation efforts. We use social computational methods to study the effects of visual graph structures and motion effects on graph perceptions, interpretations and user actions and consolidate a set of design patterns.\nPerception and Interpretation Experiments. We marry theories of visual perception and group identity to deliver theory driven chart designs that support collective awareness. Our perceptual experiments explore how these visual graph structures increase the perception of group unity.\nExplore our Gestalt Graphs\nBehavioural Game Studies Focused on Action. We build on existing behavioral game literature and propose a new visualization oriented game framework.

You might sit down with them, put the controller in their hands, and push buttons with them. You might do the first level with them, and have them copy what you do until they get it down exactly right. They’ll learn pretty quickly - if they have the right aptitude - and they’d be able to teach their friends.\nHowever, it’s pretty unlikely that they’ll be better than you by the time you’re done teaching them. If they choose to seek out different teachers - Twitch streamers, that kid at school - then odds are low they’ll get better than them.\nFortunately, there is another approach. It only requires the kid having an unrealistically large amount of time and no real needs.\nJust lock them in the room and tell them to leave once they get a perfect score.\nThey’ll start off by trying random things, hoping to stumble across some strategies that yield positive outcomes. Over time, they’ll develop some balance between doing things they know work well and trying new things. Eventually, by the time they get their perfect score, the tactics they use will be entirely original, unsullied by the influence of you or any of their friends.\nThis is the basis of reinforcement learning.\nWhile a parent should never lock their kid in a room under such circumstances, having computers play a game millions of times without telling them how to go about it has led to groundbreaking developments. The famous AlphaGo and AlphaZero agents used reinforcement learning to develop the world’s best Go AI and beat top-ranked human player Lee Sedol. Google uses this same technique to manage their data center’s energy consumption. Scientists have been harnessing the power of reinforcement learning to study protein synthesis, advertisement placement, and robots. Reinforcement learning does not learn from humans; as a result, it is free to explore beyond the bounds of our limited creativities.\nIt works by having the person define four key components: The environment The rewards The actions When the game ends\nFrom there, the reinforcement learning agent will play the game by itself many, many times (up to billions!) until it has figured out a strategy. What does that strategy look like? Internally, the agent will have figured out an expected value for each state it will encounter based on its experiences. It will then choose the actions that lead to the best future outcomes for it.\nAt RCODI, my research revolves around using a variant of reinforcement learning - one where multiple agents learn to compete against one another - to model human behavior in the public goods game.\n Project Description The collective action game is a social experiment designed to illustrate how people behave in groups.\nEach round, every player is given $10. They can contribute some amount (none, any, or a partial amount) to a group pool or they can pocket some themselves. After the rounds are over, the amount of money in the pool is multiplied by a constant and evenly distributed to each player. The amount of money a player has at the end of the game is the sum of however much they saved and their portion from the group pot.\nIf everyone could coordinate, then they would all donate $10 each round to make a lot of money. However, it turns out that one would make more money if they convinced everyone else to donate each round but they saved their own money. Moreover, in practice, nobody wants to be the sucker donating everything while others save.\nIn practice, most people will act based on how the others playing the game will act. They will donate a lot if others are contributing a lot, and they will donate little if others are donating a little. This is called conditional cooperation. About 70% of people will play this game in this manner.\nMy research involves studying how the information available to the player influences their behavior. I model a conditionally cooperative agent using a rules-based model and two reinforcement learning agents. The rules-based model simulates whether or not the agent should be competitive or cooperative, and then the reinforcement learning agent will take over.\nThe reinforcement learning agent will analyze the given situation and recommend a contribution.

We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach.","tags":["Open innovation","Survey"],"title":"The Adoption of Open Innovation in Large Firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Jeff Nickerson","Satyam Mukherjee"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"bd9f433ee260d552d83a4f826a6711bc","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-dynamics-2018/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:52.462914Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-dynamics-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Dynamics of Design Microstructures in Open Collaboration: A Motif Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["uncategorized"],"content":"Facts, Fiction and Thesis Help Soon after submitting your purchase, you\u0026rsquo;ll possess the ability to make use of our site to acquire connected with your author and speed that the work.

While designers face the challenge of designing complex socio-technical systems (Norman and Stappers 2015), eco-feedback lacks comprehensive theoretical contributions to guide such efforts. This paper followed the PRISMA-P structured review method and reports on mostly empirical papers (N=36) on eco-feedback design from the past decade (2006-2016). The aim was to systematize the emerging field by classifying feedback types according to their impact on end users and identify theoretical grounding. Through our deep inductive engagement with the studies, we present four eco-feedback affordances: (1) Inform for awareness change; (2) Incentivize for motivation change; (3) Educate for behavioral change; and (4) Control for convenience. Current research is corroborating empirical evidence in support of eco-feedback, but their lack of theoretical grounding has resulted in incomparable constructs and inconsistent results.","tags":[],"title":"Affordances Of Eco-Feedback Design in Home Energy Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"RCODI welcomes Visiting Professor, Dean Wang Changfeng.

The Internet has supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a platform’s programming community that produces these digital scientific innovations. The article’s main theoretical argument is that beyond an individual’s contribution efforts to these innovations, a new social structure affects his scientific recognition through citations of his tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory lens, we introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who jointly work on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces among the community members in an analogy to Newton’s gravity concept. Our model represents such dependencies in a spatial autocorrelative model. We empirically estimate this model using data of the programming community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers have contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a programmer’s contributions to digital innovations may have positive effects, while the digital practice structure creates negative dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being surrounded by star performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling scientific impact needs to account for a scientist’s contribution to programming communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital work structures in which these contributions are embedded.","tags":[],"title":"Creating impact in the digital space: digital practice dependency in communities of digital scientific innovations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Computerwelt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"1f9ec46c3c24199492ceb3fab965f805","permalink":"/publication/computerwelt-alpbach-2016/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:08.352667Z","relpermalink":"/publication/computerwelt-alpbach-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"\"Alpbach Technology Forum 2016\": \"New Enlightenment\"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"72017b456efcf3348cf59ff14231ef95","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-how-2016/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:00.273941Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-how-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a conundrum when a firm engages deeply with external sources in its open innovation projects. This conundrum is related to the simultaneous activities of knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting. Many studies about open innovation have focused on the role of legal formalization in the context of intellectual property (IP) control. But legal formalization around IP may not address more specific activities of the parties such as tacit knowledge of involved individuals that may lead to revealing too much knowledge. In this study, we introduce formality into the joint technology development process itself, an alternative form of formalization, to manage this conundrum. Moreover, we argue that as the firm attempts to solve more complex problems, the importance of the formal joint process increases. We test our argument based on a sample of 82 open innovation projects collected from large firms in the United States and Europe. Our results clearly indicate that to manage the conundrum of simultaneously engaging in knowledge sharing and knowledge protecting, formalizing the joint technology development process seems to have a positive effect on projects outcomes that gets stronger as the problem becomes complex. We contribute to external sourcing literature by suggesting that the process formalization may support the legal formalization of IP control to manage the knowledge sharing and protecting tension. Moreover, we make important theoretical contributions to literature regarding relational mechanisms in interorganizational collaborations through our assertion that the combination of formality and informality between the partners seems to be required to increase the likelihood of success of open innovation projects without the loss of critical intellectual property.","tags":[],"title":"How to Manage the Downside of Deep Engagement with External Sources in Open Innovation Projects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"69919a0f62f5aa74dcc711e3b613dd21","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-open-2016-1/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:00.091793Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-open-2016-1/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a controversial discussion on the role of transparency in open data contests. Existing designs of open data contests adopt transparency in different ways and report positive and negative implications for the innovation productivity of the contest contributors. This paper studies the role of transparency as an essential socio-technical design principle of open data contest platforms. It proposes two design features of transparency, namely performance transparency and solution transparency that allow the crowd to develop novel open data applications by integrating entrepreneurial experimentation with re-use for innovation. Adopting a design science method, we develop and test an open data contest platform design that jointly affords performance and solution transparency. Our pilot study of an open data mash-up hackathon provides evidence that these transparency features trigger both independent path creation and re-use for innovation. The result also shows mere copying will not result in good performance.

Open collaboration, which originated in open source software, has spread beyond software. Open collaboration communities usually have three types of actors who collaborate by selectively revealing problems and solutions. These actors, that propose problems and solution to the community, are: 1) independent users, 2) firm users, and 3) firm producers. The proposed problems can be either path dependent, which build on prior problems, or path creating problems, which are novel functionalities or features. This article theorizes about the characteristics of the structure of collaboration in open collaboration, by drawing from a theory of organizational path constitution. The proposed theoretical framework argues that actors within a community do not only solve problems by themselves (i.e. independent problem solving), but other actors also solve other actors´ problems (i.e. shared problem solving). Furthermore, the proposed theoretical framework allows understanding the importance of who revealed the problem and what type of problem was revealed in independent and shared problem solving. We perform a multinomial logit model analysis using a two year data from a successful open source software development in Open Stack, in which all three types of actors identified more than 5,000 problems. Our results provide novel empirical insights into the structure of open collaboration. In independent problem solving, our findings suggest that any actor solves novel problems rather than focusing on path dependent ones. However, in shared problem solving, firm actors focus only on novel problems revealed by independent or firm users. Moreover, independent users focus indiscriminately on improving prior problems and novel problems from firm users.","tags":[],"title":"Who Solves Whose Problem in Open Collaboration?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"628fcbf4480c4ef3e18ebb7ea0a6b514","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-who-2016/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:59.924842Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-who-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Who Solves Whose Problem in Open Collaboration?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Mehdi Bagherzadeh","Allison Lamb","Raghav Narsalay","Yu Jing"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"4ae0cef8234243789e1d57a552ddb03c","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-managing-2016/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:48:59.747895Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-managing-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Managing Open Innovation Projects with Impact","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"9a65d88edf808a82d1a31b007fc79245","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-open-2016-4/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:05.905107Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-open-2016-4/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"From Open Source towards Open Innovation: Fostering Corporate Innovation with Open Source Software (OSS) Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"Our very own Master’s Student, Charles Song and his team placed 2nd last weekend in the first “Internet of Things Civic Hackathon” in Fishers, Indiana, run by AT\u0026amp;T and Code for America’s Indiana branch, Open Indy Brigade.

Informal SDOs, which are self-organized and not mandated by law, co-exist with formal SDOs to develop compatibility standards in a substituting or complementing way. As a result, the process of standardization evolves within and across multiple SDOs. An examination of the process of managing standardization across collaborating formal and informal SDOs can fundamentally change our theoretical understanding of governance of standardization. Drawing upon the tensions-based view, we argue that fundamental characteristics of the co-existence of complementary standardization are dynamic and contradictory. To balance such tensions, generative responses within and across formal and informal SDOs are required. This two-staged case study research examines the emergence of five tensions throughout the collaboration of two SDOs, HL7 and ISO, in health informatics. Our results explain the contradictory nature of five tensions with respect to (1) technological functions, (2) legal purview and geographic scope, (3) trigger, (4) time, and (5) usage/IPR and how they evolve over time. We also empirically derive three governance responses to such tensions, namely dynamic and multi-level roles, dynamic processes, and evolving resources; these responses allow members of the SDOs to respond to these tensions in a way that succeeds in managing the process of standardization. This research provides a novel theoretical understanding of governance of standardization for innovation. We conclude with recommendations for policy makers and standards developers.","tags":["Innovation","Governance","Standardization","Compatibility","Paradox of tensions","Sdos"],"title":"Standardization Through Formal and Informal Standard Development Organizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Nickerson Steven","Brian Butler","Christian Wagner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"1a90bf9077588b9802b51b1eee1cf308","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-evolution-2014/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:13.714704Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-evolution-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The evolution of ideas by crowds and communities: Competition versus cooperation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"A group of motivated hackers finished their second out of three submissions last night at Midnight for the Blue IronHacks and are now up for judging by our expert panel. “The submissions so far have taken into account various problem aspects and settings, and it is truly impressive what the hackers are doing with Open Data”, said Cheryl Hsiang, one of our researchers and judges.

The term “open strategy” suggests that openness does not only relate to managing openness in an individual R\u0026amp;D project or in the idea-to-launch process. Open strategizing implies a more open approach towards managing the strategy and policy processes. Open strategy as a process is emerging in private firms which open up their corporate R\u0026amp;D strategy processes. In addition, public organizations emphasize openness when developing strategies and policies. Openness in strategy processes may appear in many different forms, such as the integration of a large number of internal employees. In addition, there are open strategy processes where organizations engage with external stakeholders to co-create novel strategic ideas for emerging strategic areas. In some cases, open strategy making is more concerned with communication to the public. Participatory strategy processes regularly making use of IT (e.g. crowdsourcing platforms) which affords novel ways to engage a large number of participants. There are two key dimensions that characterize open strategy making, namely (1) greater internal and external transparency as well as (2) greater inclusiveness of various actors in strategy-making, internal and external. Greater openness on these dimensions is clearly opposed to conventional notions of strategy which treat it as exclusive and secretive rather than inclusive and transparent. Information systems may both afford or constrain openness in strategy processes.

The term “open strategy” suggests that openness does not only relate to managing openness in an individual R\u0026amp;D project or in the idea-to-launch process. Open strategizing implies a more open approach towards managing the strategy and policy processes. Open strategy as a process is emerging in private firms which open up their corporate R\u0026amp;D strategy processes. In addition, public organizations emphasize openness when developing strategies and policies. Openness in strategy processes may appear in many different forms, such as the integration of a large number of internal employees. In addition, there are open strategy processes where organizations engage with external stakeholders to co-create novel strategic ideas for emerging strategic areas. In some cases, open strategy making is more concerned with communication to the public. Participatory strategy processes regularly making use of IT (e.g. crowdsourcing platforms) which affords novel ways to engage a large number of participants. There are two key dimensions that characterize open strategy making, namely (1) greater internal and external transparency as well as (2) greater inclusiveness of various actors in strategy-making, internal and external. Greater openness on these dimensions is clearly opposed to conventional notions of strategy which treat it as exclusive and secretive rather than inclusive and transparent. Information systems may both afford or constrain openness in strategy processes. With this special session we call for papers that tackle open strategy in R\u0026amp;D and the strategic use of information systems in open strategy in R\u0026amp;D from different perspectives and theoretical lenses (e.g. network theory, micro-political approaches, theory of affordances). We are interested in advancing existing theory and strongly encourage empirical contributions that span both the private as well as the public sector.

In software engineering, modularization is the traditional technique intended to reduce the interdependencies among modules that constitute a system. Reducing technical dependencies, the theory argues, results in a reduction of work dependencies between teams developing interdependent modules. Although that research stream has been quite influential, it considers a static view of the problem of coordination in engineering activities. Building on a dynamic view of coordination, we studied the relationship between socio-technical congruence and software quality and development productivity. In order to investigate the generality of our findings, our analyses were performed on two large-scale projects from two companies with distinct characteristics in terms of product and process maturity. Our results revealed that the gaps between coordination requirements and the actual coordination activities carried out by the developers significantly increased software failures. Our analyses also showed that higher levels of congruence are associated with improved development productivity. Finally, our results showed the congruence between dependencies and coordinative actions is critical both in mature development settings as well as in novel and dynamic development contexts.","tags":["Programming","Organizations","Productivity","Software metrics","Complexity theory","Modularization","Software engineering","Software quality","Context","Coordination activity","Coordination breakdowns","Coordination requirements","Development process","Development productivity","Dynamic development contexts","Engineering activity","Interdependent modules","Large-scale projects","Metrics/measurement","Organizational management and coordination","Process maturity","Product maturity","Quality analysis and evaluation","Socio-technical congruence","Software development projects","Software failures","Software reliability","Technical dependency","Work dependency"],"title":"Coordination Breakdowns and Their Impact on Development Productivity and Software Failures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Brunswicker","Cara Wrigley","Sam Bucolo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"3c8a53fc00b15f4aa4f053b1b921f6e9","permalink":"/publication/brunswicker-business-2013/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:03.450162Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brunswicker-business-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Business Model Experimentation: What is the Role of Design_led Prototyping in Developing Novel Business Models?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henry Chesbrough","Sabine Brunswicker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618258122,"objectID":"74949630b4090ffc0cc4c39ab9ee68bb","permalink":"/publication/chesbrough-managing-2013/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T16:49:12.318088Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chesbrough-managing-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Managing open innovation in large firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

How does transparency in open data contests affect civic participation? How does transparency influence the novelty, usefulness, and popularity of open data solutions? Are there differences in the way agencies and citizens evaluate the innovativeness of these solutions?   In a series of \u0026lsquo;first-of-its-kind\u0026rsquo; 3 weeks fully virtual hacks known as \u0026ldquo;The Purdue IronHacks\u0026rdquo;, we explore transparency and participation in Open Data (OD) solutions in OD contests. The OD project introduces the concept of innovation performance transparency and solution transparency in OD contests. We draw upon the theory of private-collective innovation, self-organizing governance and our previous research in organizing innovation contests, collective action, and open public policy and problem solving. The goal of this project is to provide a new perspective on how to promote impact from governmental OD. Using machine readable open datasets from Data.gov focusing on the areas of: Health, Energy, Climate, Education, Finance, Public Safety, and Global Development, we conduct an empirical quantitative study to explain the effect of innovation performance transparency and solution transparency on governmental OD impact.\nFollowing a data driven and computational research approach, in a series of quasi-experimental OD contests, several hundred citizens, developers, and students will participate in a ‘virtual’ lab environment. Non-expert citizens and developers will collaborate to identify problems, share different perspectives, critical decisions, and seek solutions. The degree of innovation performance transparency and solution transparency will be measured in order to determine the effect of transparency on participation and innovation. Findings from these experiments will be implemented in larger national OD contests, such as the National Day of Civic Hacking. In sum, this study will provide evidence-based guidelines for the design of OD contests and how to utilize transparency and knowledge sharing to increase the impact of governmental OD.\nDuration: 24 months\nInvestigators: Sabine Brunswicker, Ann Majchrzak, Esteve Almirall.\nPartners \u0026amp; Sponsorship Partners: RedHat, Socrata, City of West Lafayette, \u0026amp; Purdue Hackers\nSponsor(s): NSF, Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSPI)\n","date":1278887049,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619062630,"objectID":"a64e2f1dd8d45248128ad813e75518be","permalink":"/project/transparency-in-open-data-contest/","publishdate":"2010-07-11T22:24:09Z","relpermalink":"/project/transparency-in-open-data-contest/","section":"project","summary":"This study measures the degree of innovation performance transparency and solution transparency to determine the effect of transparency on participation and innovation.\nTransparency in Open Data Contest Primary Research Questions:","tags":["digital-innovation","digital-transparency","global-executive-study","government","manage-innovation-in-impact","open-innovation","open-source-software-practices","transparency-in-open-contest","Current"],"title":"Transparency in Open Data Contest","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["digital-innovation"],"content":"This project extracts granular perceptual, behavioral and interaction data.\nGraph Based Feedback for Collaborative Energy Consumption Data-driven feedback and interactions with personal devices are changing the way we make decisions. They increasingly use visual interactive graphs (e.g. bar charts) that allow us to explore variability in our own behaviors and those of others. They aim to motivate behavioral change, for example through greater self-awareness and review of personal progress. However, today’s visual graphs often fail to facilitate the fundamental tasks of collective action, such as preserving the environment and saving energy. Yet, cooperation is needed to overcome problems of social loafing and our tendency to act selfishly. This project explores how visual data-driven graphs may lead to sustained cooperative behavior if they frame our choices from a group’s perspective. A graph’s content, its data and metrics, but also the way this content is visually presented may elicit cooperative behavior. The goal is to develop a visual graph theory that articulates how fundamental visual graph features lead to collective-oriented perceptions and actions through a unifying visual graph grammar. To do so, we conduct a series of controlled perceptual experiments using human computational methods and public good games, in which individuals interact with visual graphs. The goal is to move beyond design heuristics and furnish causal relationships between visual graph features and perceptions. This project will extract granular perceptual, behavioral and interaction data using new data collection techniques, empirical and experimental studies, and will create tangible artifacts.\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impact\n New human-centric visual graph grammar. New graph grammar encoded in actual software code, for the context of collective action. Causal relationships between visual graph feature on perceived unity and cooperative behavior. Using controlled experiments we overcome the limitation of design heuristics in guiding graph design. Results will contribute to fields of data visualization and Human Computer Interaction (HCI), but also to the work on collective action that still ignores the role of graph-based interaction using digital devices.

Existing academic literature and theories on open innovation have regularly focused on firm-level aggregates to understand the role of open innovation in firm performance; they have not provided sufficient insights into the adoption of open innovation at a project level. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at the Purdue University and the Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation at the University of California-Berkeley in collaboration with Fraunhofer-Society want to address this gap by conducting this research. We implemented the second Open Innovation Executive Survey in order to deepen our understanding of adoption of open innovation not only at firm-level but also at project level. In a nutshell, in this research project, we aim to implement a quantitative survey study on open innovation among senior executives in large firms in the USA, Europe and Japan with the main focus on different open innovation practices, new practices, ways to deal with managing and sharing know-how and IP, and new ways to measure open innovation performance.\nDuration: 22 months (3/2014-1/2016)\nRelated Research ","date":1268605449,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618329579,"objectID":"fc54ea24e9b12dcf5145193d873e565c","permalink":"/project/2014-2015-global-open-innovation-executive-study/","publishdate":"2010-03-14T22:24:09Z","relpermalink":"/project/2014-2015-global-open-innovation-executive-study/","section":"project","summary":"Open innovation is growing into a mainstream phenomenon of increasing business relevance in large firms where 78 percent of large firms in the sample had been applying open innovation.\nGlobal Open Innovation Executive Study In 2012, a large-scale Open Innovation Executive Survey was conducted by UC- Berkeley and Fraunhofer-Society to explore to what extent open innovation was applied in large firms in the USA and Europe.","tags":["Concluded"],"title":"Global Open Innovation Executive Study 2014/2015","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["open-innovation","Featured"],"content":"This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation.\nManaging Open Innovation with Business Impact in the Digital Age In collaboration with the Accenture Institute for High Performance (AIHP), we have implemented a series of open innovation (OI) case studies to generate new insights on how large, innovative firms use open innovation to solve their strategic innovation problems. One particular example concluded in 2017 is that of Samsung, and its endeavor to seek IoT prototypes created by communities participating in an open innovatoin challenge. Read about it here. Dr. Brunswicker and\nWith the increased digital transformation of many sectors, such problems are increasingly difficult to address. Our preliminary research suggests that one of the keys to running a successful open innovation program is choosing the correct operational mode of open innovation for the business problem at hand. This requires evaluating problem complexity and knowledge uncertainty associated with a business problem.\nA number of companies who have chosen to integrate open innovation have realized that there are specific management practices required to effectively execute open innovation. Open innovation problems can involve a high level of uncertainty and technological complexity and require firms to move from traditional modes of collaboration (such as alliances) towards more open interactions with deeper exchanges of know-how and greater ambiguity such as crowds and communities. There are management challenges specific to open innovation that require a unique set of strategies and processes to be in place in order to overcome these challenges and be able to achieve higher business value through open innovation.\nThis study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation by selecting the appropriate open innovation model, and integrating successful management strategies to balance the tensions of knowledge sharing and protection in the midst of strategic and operational ambiguity. This framework will also equip open innovation leaders with new insights into successful practices for creating business impact from open innovation.\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impacts\n Develop a guided open innovation framework to help leverage optimal value.

Looking beyond traditional modes for solving these problems, this research sheds light on civic innovation crowdsourcing; a new open model of innovation for solving societal problems in the public and government sector. Through a unique case study, a civic innovation contest sponsored by Bombardier was examined using content analysis. Civic innovation crowdsourcing and how team submissions and geographic contextualization shape the problem solving process was examined in three major cities, Belo Horizonte, Vientiane, and London.\nResearchers found that: 1.: Civic Innovation Crowdsourcing creates a diverse set of comprehensive solutions and highlights key complexity attributes from a citizen’s perspective, 2: crowd members tackle complexity at the level of each problem dimension and collectively highlight critical attributes and novel solutions, 3.: Civic Innovation Crowdsourcing furnishes an alternative mode of urban problem solving and affords addressing complexity breadth, and 4.: team and individual submissions differ in the way they address complexity, with teams addressing more attributes of a problem than individuals. This case suggests that designing with the crowd may overcome a central ‘tragedy’ of urban Mobility: While mobility is a greater good that is fundamental for cities to flourish, it puts other public good at risk. Thus, only jointly with the citizens, can businesses, city councils, and NGOs design future mobile urban ecosystems that will ‘evolve’ towards greater economic, social, and ecological performance.\nInvestigators: Volker Bilgram, Sabine Brunswicker, Johann Fueller\nKeywords: Crowdsource; Wicked problems; Civic innovation; Crowdsourcing innovation; Innovation facilitation; Bombardier Inc.\nRelated Publications and News\nBrunswicker, S., V.

Troublesome ideas and opinions may impact their work reputation, standing within the organization, and even their future employment.\nOne option is to make all contributions to internal Open Innovation Challenges anonymous, however, that would reduce the social and reputational rewards associated with participation and co-creation of solutions. Working in conjunction with Bright Idea, a leading Open Innovation Platform provider, we are testing the impact of selective anonymity, where participants can flag their contributions to be displayed anonymously. Using selective anonymity, participants can enjoy all the usual reputational and social rewards that are accrued while participating in an Open Innovation Challenge, while simultaneously offering risk-free minority dissent, which is necessary to increase the diversity of opinions and inspire creativity.\nWe are Partnering with Landcare Research, one of seven Crown Research organizations in New Zealand, to test the effects of selective anonymity on participant contributions.

Prior studies have highlighted the positive influences of open innovation activities on innovation outcomes in large firms (Parida et al., 2012).\nHowever, few studies have investigated the key governance mechanism of open innovation and their interaction to induce higher level of innovation performance in specific collaborative open innovation projects. We simultaneously examine the influence of external search breadth and depth in open innovation partners’ interactions on project performance. We contend that: (a) these two dimensions influence open innovation project performance through different governance mechanisms (process control, outcome control); and (b) the project’s related innovation complexity alters the effect of external search breadth and depth on open innovation project performance.\nWe develop and test a moderated mediation model in which external search breadth and depth influence open innovation project performance through their effects by different governance mechanisms, and these indirect effects are moderated by different levels of innovation complexity.\nWe applied structural equation modelling (SEM) using the MPlus 7.31 (Muthén \u0026amp; Muthén, 2015) to test for the hypothesized relationships among the constructs: external search breadth and depth, process control, outcome control, innovation complexity and open innovation project performance, as well as for the interaction effects of process control, outcome control and innovation complexity on open innovation project performance.\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impacts**:**\n Development of a moderated mediation model where the project performance is moderated by the different levels of innovation complexity.

This also includes using blockchain as a technology platform to study the network behavior of the blockchain industry. From an economic perspective, the research aim is to identify how new ways of constructing exchange are emerging in society. The hypothesis to test is that blockchain technology allows a new form of peer-to-peer service provision and exchange between parties, which leads to new conceptualizations, sensibilities, and practices regarding exchange.

The IronHacks platform offers participants a no-set-up programming environment and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations that help citizens and governments to make better decisions.\nExample challenges COVID-19 Data Science Challenge Use data provided by suppliers such as SafeGraph to predict areas that will be impacted by COVID-19 based on foot traffic. What are the Challenges about?\nOur COVID-19 Data Science Challenges invite participants to build statistical models and visualizations that monitor and predict social movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic over time. The goal is to predict weekly patterns of movement and social interaction in our local communities to understand COVID-19 risks.\nAugust 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: This first COVID-19 Data Science Challenge focuses on predicting the foot traffic at major brands (e.g. Target, Domino\u0026rsquo;s Pizza etc.). The goal is to foresee which brands are experiencing the greatest surge in visitors.\nFall 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: Protect Purdue. This challenge asks participants to monitor and predict weekly foot traffic at thousands of places of interests (e.g. restaurants, stores, churches) in the Greater West-Lafayette. It responds to a statement made by Purdue\u0026rsquo;s Leadership team: that COVID-19 risk is not necessarily arising in campus buildings but, rather, emerging from off-campus social gatherings like in restaurants, shops, etc.\nParticipants have access to BIG actual, granular and temporal data they typically do not have access to: Data about social distancing behavior, foot traffic, COVID-19 incidents, as well as executive orders. This data is also used by state governments in the US as well scientists who try to understand social movements during COVID-19 pandemic.\nEquipped with this data, participants will work in the IronHacks workspace with JupyterLab and access to BigQuery to create novel and useful statistical models and visualizations using Python and R. Participants will submit Jupyter notebooks and their outputs (html and markdown files).\nAFFORDABLE HOUSING Build a website with interactive visualizations that helps new students in finding safe and affordable housing near their university.\nWORKFORCE ANALYTICS Use workforce data to explore factors that affect successful career paths.\n How does the process work? IronHacks is a global virtual open data hacking platform that allows users to participate in a high-energy IronHacks competition. The IronHacks platform offers participants a no setup workspace with JupyterLab and BigQueryintegration and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations. It also offers training and tutorials, as well as a personal dashboard to view scores and progress through the competition. After registration, participants can warm-up, practice their skills and query sample data until sufficient participants have joined to launch the competition. After the start of the competition, a multiphase process will start. Each challenge moves through the following phases.\n Registration and warm-up phase: If you have registered for one of the Challenges that are available, you will have the opportunity to warm-up using our tutorials. Start of competition followed by multiphase process: The competition starts based on invitation, usually followed by multiple interim and one final submission Interim submissions: At multiple interim submission points, you will receive immediate feedback on your current standing, giving you the opportunity to improve over time. Final submission: There will be a final submission before we identify the winners. Our Impact The scientific team at Purdue generated new knowledge and technologies on the implications of machine-enabled feedback and transparency on participant\u0026rsquo;s productivity and innovation performance.\nSince 2015, thousands of participants have hacked in parallel virtually around the globe gaining valuable experience in coding as well as work for the chance to win internships, Amazon gift cards, cool swag, and certificates. In addition to the students participation and learning, IronHacks provide the opportunity to do research on open innovation contest processes.\nParticipants developed novel and useful open data solutions in an interactive environment. The platform\u0026rsquo;s features helped them continuously improve their submissions while learning from real-time feedback and others participating in the hack. A new virtual movement of hacking has emerged at Purdue and beyond. Participants come from the U.S., Colombia, and China. Virtual setting encourages a more diverse audience.\nLearn More About IronHacks Hack in our next challenge! Read through our blog\nOnline walkthrough\nInterested in partnering or have a question?
