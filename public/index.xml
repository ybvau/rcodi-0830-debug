      <title>Spotlight Feature: Elkady, Patel, Dr. Brunswicker present about skills &amp; platform engagement</title>
      <link>/post/2021-06-29-feny-mai-paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 21:32:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2021-06-29-feny-mai-paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCODI Fellows Mai Elkady, Feny Patel, and RCODI Director Dr. Sabine Brunswicker recently wrote about research on skills and engagement relative to Collective Intelligence. The three were  and were invited to present at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm-ci2021.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2021 ACM-CI Conference&lt;/a&gt; to present their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper covers the role of skills and platform engagement within a crowdsourcing platform. The three researchers used data generated from the Purdue IronHacks project. Their methods include using a variety of machine learning models (survival with Kaplan-Meier estimator, K-means &amp;amp; centroids derived from Ward&amp;rsquo;s agglomerative hierarchical clustering) to understand temporal engagement, provile skillsets and engagement, and to build predictive user submission models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elkady, Patel, and Dr. Brunswicker will be presenting research on June 29th between 15.00-16.00 Central European Time. Find more about the program &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acm-ci2021.com/program&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on the ACM-Ci website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AOM Best Paper Proceedings for RCODI</title>
      <link>/post/6601-best-paper-award-aom/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/6601-best-paper-award-aom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;www.aom.org&#34;&gt;Academy of Management (AOM)&lt;/a&gt; recently honored Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and her collaborator Dr. Saytam Mukherjee for their research on coordination technology development and innovation in complex organizational settings like Open Source Software (OSS), in which a large number of developers work at distance, at different time zones, and outside of formal employment relationships. They specifically focus on software development in &lt;a href=&#34;www.openstack.com&#34;&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most widely deployed open source cloud software in the world. Their paper with the title &lt;strong&gt;Evolution of Coordination Structures in Open Source Software Development: An Exponential Random Graph Model&lt;/strong&gt; was honored with a Best Paper Proceedings Award of the 81st Annual Meeting of the Academy of
Management (29 July - 4 August 2021). It was judged as one the best accepted papers following a double-blinded review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, Brunswicker &amp;amp; Mukherjee examine how two relational mechanisms - preferential attachment and knowledge similarity - predict the formation of Open-Source Software (OSS) coordination structures as they evolve over time. Drawing upon methods in network science and machine learning, they specify and implement an Exponential Random Graph Model (p*) using data from 619 developers in Nova, OpenStack, working on 2597 Python files between 2012 and 2016. Throughout all evolutionary stages,  the results of the computational model furnish statistical evidence of positive non-linear preferential attachment causing skewed distributions distinct from a power-law. Knowledge similarity has a significantly positive effect but impacts only early stages of coordination. The paper&amp;rsquo;s findings advance the literature on OSS and digital innovation more broadly. The findings also inform practice of coordinating distributed work in software development and other technology-intensive settings more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We need you to hack COVID 2.0</title>
      <link>/post/ih2.0/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-day-youve-been-waiting-for-is-here--the-spring-and-summer-ironhacks-data-science-challenge-is-live-and-society-needs-your-help&#34;&gt;The day you&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for is here – the Spring and Summer IronHacks Data Science Challenge is live, and society needs your help.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vaccines are distributed and society is returning to the norm, data scientists seasoned and new are using the IronHacks platform to make an impact in the community by predicting what the foot traffic at COVID hotspots will be over time. While hacking for social cause over the course of two months, top participants have a shot at winning a share of $1,000 in prizes for developing insightful models policymakers can reference to protect communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict which restaurants in Tippecanoe and Marion counties should expect the highest number of visits as COVID-19 restrictions decrease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use actual data that is updated on a weekly basis to build explanatory and communicable models to help citizens, business owners and policymakers better understand where – and why – social activity is occurring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What prior participants have said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The takeaway from the hackathon was that I could interact with everyone, but the energy was so healthy and holistic in the way things progressed. We wanted to create a societal impact and not just get to the top. You can literally get inspired by other solutions and then try to implement in your own model. This is a better way to go about it.&amp;rdquo; - Dhruvi Shah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The excitement to know how my model would perform after every round kept me enthused till the end! These predictions can give insights into social distancing norms and implement necessary precautions.&amp;rdquo; - Feny Patel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions?&lt;/strong&gt;
Reach out to the IronHacks team &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:d27b1045.groups.purdue.edu@amer.teams.ms&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ironhacks.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ready to hack for social good?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;IronHacks Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RCODI Director Sabine Brunswicker recently gave a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ispim-innovation.com/post/sabine-brunswicker-on-responding-to-the-crisis-with-digital-innovation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;keynote talk&lt;/a&gt; as part of ISPIM’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ispim-virtual.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;virtual conference&lt;/a&gt; on responding to the COVID-19 crisis. The virtual conference was held June 7-10, 2020 with many leading researchers and experts in the interdisciplinary fields of innovation. As a top thought leader in this area, she discussed her passion for researching about digital platforms, and the interplay between AI and human intelligence. During the talk, Professor Brunswicker shared details on how crowds can help in responding to this type of complex epidemiological and economic crisis through digital innovation. In particular, digital innovation via crowds can help reduce levels of uncertainty while also focusing attention on flexibility, diversity of ideas, sustainability and resource efficiency. Additionally, Professor Brunswicker highlights how crises can create certain unexpected events and changes which make traditional AI models fragile, thus benefiting from the human intelligence component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original talk was presented on June 9th, 2020, but recordings are available from ISPIM through July 15th, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLOS ONE Call for Papers: Cities as Complex Systems</title>
      <link>/post/6536-plos-one-call-for-papers-cities-as-complex-systems/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 19:25:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/6536-plos-one-call-for-papers-cities-as-complex-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cities are centers of human interactions and the innovations that arise from them. Urbanization has led to many positive developments for society, but also contributes to many of our most pressing challenges, from sustainability and climate change to poverty and inequality. Concepts from complex systems and network theory provide valuable approaches to further our understanding of the processes which drive how cities form, grow, and operate as environments which are more than the sum of their parts. With its commitment to open access, and rigorous, reproducible research,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is the ideal venue for interdisciplinary complexity science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our director, an academic editor of PLOS ONE in the area of network science/complex systems is excited to announce a Call for Papers on Cities as Complex Systems, bringing together researchers across scientific disciplines to build a collection of complex systems and networks research applied to questions in urban science. Our Guest Editors Marta González and Diego Rybski are particularly interested in reading research on urban mobility and energy infrastructures, the morphology and efficiency of cities, and applications to sustainable development goals.&lt;em&gt;Topics may include but are not limited to urban mobility and migration, urban scaling laws, social networks within cities, urban resilience, financial networks within and between cities, smart cities and internet-of-things, and agent-based models of urban phenomena. More details can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://collections.plos.org/s/cities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The submission deadline is July 3, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Challenge for Social Change</title>
      <link>/project/music-challenge-for-social-change/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 18:24:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/music-challenge-for-social-change/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tipping-point-community-platform-for-a-x201cmusic-for-social-changex201d-challenge&#34;&gt;The Tipping Point Community Platform for a “Music for Social Change” Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powered by RCODI IronHacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-it&#34;&gt;Why do we need it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has shown that music can bond people together and motivate them to act collectively. What if during this time of potential ecological and societal collapse, we can use the potential of music to save our future? What if music could trigger &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;social tipping points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, thresholds at which the actions of a few artists and their fan base engage the masses to act actively in order to realize social change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are young artists who want their art to go beyond “feel good music” and inspire meaningful actions from and with their followers. However, popular metrics such as Billboard Top 100 do not give them sufficient capacity for their songs to become a &lt;strong&gt;Call to Action&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rcodi.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Research Center for Open Digital Innovation  (RCODI)&lt;/a&gt; and its members and fellows, have joined forces with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.earthwisecenter.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EARTHwise Centre&lt;/a&gt; to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUR VISION:&lt;/strong&gt;  Every artist should have access to a community platform to co-create songs that ignite collective action for a thrivable world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-whom-is-it&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For whom is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our digital platform connects three key actors to co-create a playlist of songs that call a global audience to take action for social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./globe-black-and-white-world-clip-art-earth-black-and-white.png&#34; alt=&#34;for block on &amp;apos;who uses the platform&amp;apos;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artists&lt;/strong&gt;
(musicians, cultural creatives) who co-create songs throughout an iterative process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advisors&lt;/strong&gt;
(experts in “thrivability” focused not only on sustainability but also social and human capital to regenerate planetary, social, cognitive as well as spiritual resources) who advise artists in defining their call for action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listeners&lt;/strong&gt;
(you, me, and people around the world) who help artists to learn about the potential of their lyrics and sounds to motivate others to follow their call for action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-key-features&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community platform offers artists a range of novel features to create songs that ignite action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUR SONGS&lt;/strong&gt;: Access to the community’s co-created songs prior to the global release of the tipping point playlist (e.g. via Spotify)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY STUDIO:&lt;/strong&gt; A space to create and upload different versions of an artist’s song (its audio, its narrative) with features to implement the song’s call for actions (e.g. donations related to the song)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY RESULTS:&lt;/strong&gt; Access to feedback from advisors and listeners as well as access to song analytics (e.g.
“danceability”, listener engagement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY SOCIAL NETWORK&lt;/strong&gt;: Access to a discussion forum to engage in the dialogue with like-minded artists who want to thrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY LAB:&lt;/strong&gt; Tools and tutorials to learn about digital music production, “thrivability,” and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-benefits-for-artists&#34;&gt;The benefits for artists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./thrive-spotify.png&#34; alt=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a community of creatives for social change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-create a song that calls for action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select a curated global initiatives  (e.g. charity or fund) to implement your song’s call for action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your song featured in the Tipping Point channels and playlists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./bg-pattern-blue-dots.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-research-and-tech-development&#34;&gt;The research and tech development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interdisciplinary team of scientists, designers, artists, and platform engineers (more details&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n-Fgy11di6IUmD8QZKqbZMjFCTDsacnTp8DyCqJSbhc/edit?usp=sharing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;) can build upon several years of scientific research and practical development experiences on how to design digital platforms for co-creation and collective action. We have worked with thousands of individuals and hackers around the world to scientifically validate platform features, incentive systems, social technologies, and interface designs for co-creation. Such efforts were supported by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nsf.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and donations from industry leaders who are convinced that digital technologies can democratize innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few months, we build upon these foundations to design and built the first version of the tipping point community platform. It will use state of the art of web technologies (MERN stack), data science techniques, and AI models (e.g. natural language processing, deep learning, network analytics, agent-based modeling). Our goal is to launch it in summer/fall 2020 along with a global call for the music for social change challenge. This platform will also be the foundation of a multi-year research program focused on the 1) role of music for collective action, 2) the nature of social tipping points in the context of thrivability, and 3) the constituting tole of digital technologies and information design for enabling collective action. You can learn more about the research program &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n-Fgy11di6IUmD8QZKqbZMjFCTDsacnTp8DyCqJSbhc/edit?usp=sharing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-intended-impact&#34;&gt;Our intended impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is that with the launch of a music for social change challenge in fall 2020, we can make impact and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involve thousands of artists in the co-creation challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and release a final Spotify playlist with 100 songs calling for collective action across multiple dimensions of social change (e.g. related to different &lt;a href=&#34;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sustainability development goals&lt;/a&gt; of the United Nations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop new sound and text analytics features (based on machine and deep learning methods) measuring the the latent properties of songs that explains the songs’ potential to enable coherent actions for social change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the platform as a “living lab” to understand what features of the platform can &lt;em&gt;unify&lt;/em&gt; the emotions and actions of thousands of people (despite their geographic, cultural, and social differences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable and predict social tipping points – thresholds at which songs become viral and motivate the masses to take actions for the social good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-our-vision&#34;&gt;Support our vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCODI and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.earthwise.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EARTHwise Centre&lt;/a&gt; calls for your support to make this vision reality.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-scholar-assistants-from-colombia-arrived-to-rcodi&#34;&gt;New scholar assistants from Colombia arrived to RCODI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running the last version of The Ironhacks contest at Universidad Nacional de Colombia early this year, Cristian Baquero (left on the picture), winner on the Best Solution category, and Alejandro Díaz (left on the picture), Student ambassador of RCODI at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, arrived at Purdue University to assist the Ironhacks Team on research activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are students of Systems and Computing engineering at Universidad Nacional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time Cristian visit the United States; &amp;ldquo;I am very grateful for the opportunity to be here at Purdue, I hope I can learn from Professor Brunswicker a lot and to experience the culture of this country&amp;rdquo; says Cristian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both students will be at campus till January 6th 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Alejandro, this is the second time he came to the States to assist the team as main software developer. He designed and programed the new version of The Ironhacks Platform, a web application that is used to run programing marathons online, which is the main tool used by the team to gather data. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here to continue the development process with the team, we aim to run a contest around the world with hundreds of people participating at the same time, this is a very ambitious project!&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

The National University of Colombia (UNAL) proved to be a triumphant setting once again for the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation. UNAL students participated in the Spring 2019 Purdue IronHacks competition and were challenged to create an app to help university students find safe and affordable housing in the New York area. For the first treatment group, José Fernando Morantes Florez, Jhonatan Sandoval Velasco, Juan Pulido won first, second, and third respectively; Cristian Adolfo Baquero Pico, Cristian Alejandro Mantilla Duque, and Julián David Rodríguez Ruíz won first second, and third respectively for the second treatment group. With the support from the National Science Foundation and other partners such as Amazon, Red Hat, and the state of Indiana, Purdue IronHacks has undoubtedly made its impact on the global open data movement. no-repeat;center top;; Professor Nicolás Múnera Garzón, a professor at the UNAL whose students participated in Ironhacks, said he was grateful for the opportunity it provided. no-repeat;center top;; “Purdue IronHacks was a great experience for me as a teacher. Students enrolled in the software engineering class with me didn&amp;rsquo;t only learn about the common approach about crafting software that fulfills all technical requirements, they learned also this real need of delivering for real users,” Garzón said. “I&amp;rsquo;m glad and thankful that we worked with incredible people up there at Purdue. The team was always attentive and supporting making the experience even better, so I take this opportunity just to say, thank you! All of you, Alejandro, Sabine, Sebastian&amp;hellip; All of you who were involved with this initiative!” no-repeat;center top;; The IronHacks team has already received emails asking for Ironhacks to continue one more year. no-repeat;center top;; Below, you can find a testimonial video of our winner, Cristian Aldolfo. no-repeat;center top;; About Ironhacks: IronHacks is an 8-week class that combines active learning and app development with a real-world open data competition. It was designed to make hackers familiar with open data released by federal agencies and corporations. Further, it aims to trigger user-centered design of data-driven interfaces with graphs and maps that support end-user decision making. During the 5-stage iterative virtual competition, students utilize open data to create novel and useful online applications (apps) for citizens in areas such as housing, healthcare, etc. Competing participants have access to tutorials, standardized libraries and packages, and virtual help sessions. While they are engaging in an active learning process, their apps are being evaluated using automated techniques and expert judgement. Real time and targeted feedback accelerate their learning process as well as improve their programing skills and their ability to hack complex problems with open data and open standards. no-repeat;center top;; uA19asPOOos 700 400&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PhD Candidate Marlen Promann Successfully Defends Dissertation Proposal</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 21:18:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/5855-phd-candidate-marlen-promann-successfully-defends-dissertation-proposal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ACM-CHI-2018.jpg&#34;&gt;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ACM-CHI-2018.jpg&lt;/a&gt; At the end of last year, on 20th December 2018, Marlen Promann, a Purdue Independent Interdisciplinary PhD candidate (IIGP) , defended her PhD dissertation proposal wherein she asked normative questions about how social data charts support collective awareness and encourage sustainable action in the personal home context. no-repeat;center top;; Promann is interested in the explosive rise of personal data and how they are visualized to end users, nudging them to change their everyday behaviors. Inspired by Elinor Ostrom and her theory of Collective Action, Promann is passionate about leveraging technologies to empower people to collectively manage societal well-fare. Hence,her dissertation explores how charts that depict social data may encourage cooperation around societal issues like recycling, energy conservation, sustainability, social inclusion, etc. that often present users with social dilemmas about doing good in the long term or benefiting oneself in the short term. Ms. Promann uniquely blends her 10+ years of design experience (BA HonsDesign, 2005) and her social scientific research training(MSc Media and Communications, 2010) to integrate perceptual theories of design with social psychological theories to develop theoretical assumptions about how charts may convey the semantics of ‘socialunity’ that may enhance contributions to group goals. Her controlled perceptual experiments confirmed her first hypotheses that particular visual chart structures can indeed enhance perceptions of group unity;however, she found them to have particular semantic meanings of unity (room for more intriguing research). She is now working on a series of behavioral game experiments to see if such perceptual interpretive differences by chart designs can also lead to variable conservation behaviors. no-repeat;center top;; Her dissertation will make three major contributions to three different fields: (1)Pertinent to the Visualization community, Marlen’s findings highlight the importance of encoding data with appropriate visual structures and cues that support rather than contradict the message of the underlying data and/or the goal of the data feedback. (2)Uniquely to the HCI and design communities, Marlen deep dived into the psychological and perceptual theories to inform her chart designs and to empirically measure the causal effects of her designs on the end users. This empirical rigor is what has long been needed to truly test the many novel ideas that emerge within the HCI and design communities. (3)Despite prior efforts to connect the design (HCI) and behavioral science (environmental psychology, smart buildings, energy, etc.), Marlen’s work is at the forefront of connecting theory driven design with empirical evidence of specific visual cues in a design affecting behavior change. (4)Last, but not least, her efforts to leverage behavioral games to test how visual chart design may prime users to cooperate more in social dilemma situations is new to the present games literature that has largely focused on text based feedback. no-repeat;center top;; If you found this interesting, feel free to check out more about the opportunity that positive nudging can have in &lt;a href=&#34;rcodi.org/nudging&#34;&gt;this article.&lt;/a&gt; no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it be in the way the golden ratio is correlated with growth in shells or how the Pythagorean model is the reason we have stable structures, nature will always hold the key to predicting our own behavior and understanding more about ourselves. It is with this idea that &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/ourpeople&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and Dr. Satyam Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; set off to model dynamics between others in design and collaboration. Using the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=313965&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;motif structures&lt;/a&gt;, something typically used for describing and organizing href=&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824%3Ebiological&#34;&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824&amp;gt;biological&lt;/a&gt; systems, the two analyzed how files are linked instead, gaining insight into the collaborative design of source code. left no-repeat;center top;; When reprogramming and re-purposing a certain design part through modifying source files, each individual splits, augments, and inverts which change design interdependence among a small set of files. With this research, we will be able to understand the micro-level design actions that underpin the evolution of a large design artifact developed in fluid organizational forms like open source collaboration. In there, individuals self-select into tasks and make design decisions using simple heuristics (rather than real-option informed design choices). left no-repeat;center top;; Dr. Mukherjee presented their work at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmadabad this month at the international conference on &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/824&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Network Science in Economics and Finance. &lt;/a&gt; left no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FACT integrates an assemble of AI models that augment the memory and the &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; of users. It&amp;rsquo;s a distributed AI platform that federates through self-organization and novel human-AI interaction design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FACT episodic memory engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stores historical facts and sources of news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traces news content and degree of distortion over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigns trust rating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FACT intelligence engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generates narratives based on facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produces counterfactuals and &amp;ldquo;untold&amp;rdquo; stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rates trust rating of new articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facts-impact&#34;&gt;FACT&amp;rsquo;S Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary audience of FACT are ~ 30 % of the citizens living in the U.S, who are active on the social media. Using  textual, chart-based as well as conversational interactive feedback, FACT&amp;rsquo;s interface can influence end-user interpretations as well news creation, prompting continued action (such as further propagation of fact-based retweets and stories, or writing of news article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literacy about AI and distortion of news content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased trust in news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civic and Professional Journalists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence in writing trustworthy stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attention to untold stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New models for federated AI combining agent-based modeling, GAN, and human-AI interaction/design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral studies/insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facts-deliverables&#34;&gt;FACT&amp;rsquo;s Deliverables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel FACT platform distributed AI with novel human-AI interaction design:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory engine (Hebbian learning &amp;amp; agent-based simulation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligence engine (generative adversarial networks &amp;amp; agent-based modeling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human-AI interaction design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data and evaluation from controlled experiments with 500+ citizens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lab &amp;amp; field experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing effect of FACT for citizens vis-à-vis professional writers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact measures: literacy, perceived trust, confidence, and behavioral change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~250 new FACT-based stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACT channel reporting to broader audience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News produced with FACT by citizen journalists&lt;/li&gt;

The seemingly impossible task of deactivating your account on a service you no longer use. All of the above are examples of dark design patterns, or “dark UX,” where the design of a website or application is meant to benefit the brand rather than the user—even at the expense of the latter. Dark design patterns are actually a type of digital nudging, creating user-interface in a way that influences the audience’s choices. While being subconsciously influenced by what we use seems frightening, what if we could influence people to do good? left no-repeat;center top;; &lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DpjjZFKX4AE5NQG.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; That is one of the core ideas to Dr. Sabine Brunswicker and Marlen Promann’s research in The Effect of Proximity in Social Data Charts on Perceived Utility. Brunswicker and Promann discuss findings on the dissonance between visual structure and statistical structure, and how its misuse tends to result in misinterpretations. However, when used correctly, visual elements such as charts can actually elicit responses of unity and overcome certain problems such as social loafing—when certain members in a group get benefits from the group’s accomplishments despite not actively contributing like the other members. With this effect, people could be prompted to care more for larger issues that most of us tend to ignore such as sustainability. left no-repeat;center top;; 289787716 700 400 This research has opened the way for future projects on what could be called “white UX”, or design that influences its consumers to become more selfless. Through their work on visual elements and how charts can promote unity among its viewers, they have discovered a new possibility to potentially solving macro-scale social issues. left no-repeat;center top;; If you are interested in learning more, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfW1kkSsGg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; showing a practical application of data visualization, developed as part of the broader NSF grant this research is connected, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/papers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to the IEEE Information Visualization Conference where this work was presented. left no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rcodi-fellowship-fall-2018&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCODI Fellowship Fall 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-i-become-an-rcodi-undergraduate-fellow-for-fall-2018&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I become an RCODI undergraduate fellow for Fall 2018?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our state has a serious workforce problem. There more than 200,000 unfilled jobs and many counties are not taking the right measures to develop the skills of their residents. Do you want to make a change to our state’s workforce problem using data visualization? Become an undergraduate RCODI fellow for Fall 2018 (with a guaranteed stipend for the first 8 weeks) and join a cohort of other 30 to 50 students who want to use their creativity, technical skills, and analytical mind to make an impact on governments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please review the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the information about the fellowship below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the registration form that is at the end of this page or direct link &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apply-here-httpsrcodiorgfellowship-registration-form&#34;&gt;Apply &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-fellowship-structured&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the fellowship structured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is collaborating with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to launch a unique data analytics fellowship program focused on the area of &lt;strong&gt;workforce analytics&lt;/strong&gt;. The fellowship is open for a cohort of undergraduate students enrolled at Purdue University (between 30 to 50 students will be admitted) that go through a two-stage program, including undergraduate research, in which they analyze, visualize and interactively display their results in web-based “app” to be used by policymakers for their decisions on workforce development in the state of Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full program is structured in two phases. Phase 1 includes the 8-week program, in which undergraduate students explore open governmental data as well as workforce data available for the selected fellows only (e.g. skill-level, unfilled jobs, training opportunities). They will analyze, visualize the data, and make them actionable in an interactive web “app” using technologies like HTML, CSS, and D3.js (see cool data visualizations done in D3.js in Figure 1 below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure1_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: D3.js visualizations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to develop an interactive app that is used by the governmental actors and agencies when making important workforce-related decisions. The first phase is set-up as hacking challenge run by RCODI, in which a cohort of 30 to 50 students go through a structured training and tutorial program, and then participate in 5 iterative hacking events, in which they use their creativity to develop novel and useful workforce apps. Depending on performance in the first 8 weeks, Phase 2 includes the opportunity for a longer-term fellowship follow-on for selected top students to deepen their analysis and advance their project further individually or in a small team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase lasts 8 weeks and is structured in distinct phases visualized in the figure below. It starts with pre-training sessions to familiarize participants with technologies (e.g. APIs, D3.js) needed, followed by a 5-stage iterative on-campus competition. During this training period, you will also be familiarized with the DWD data during sessions run by representatives of the state, and a team of data scientists. Fellows will have access to tutorials, live help sessions, a social coding environment, and community features. Automatic hosting of apps, code evaluations, and workflow support for usability judging provides additional assistance to the hackers in agile design and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure2_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Process for phase 1 of the hacking program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training period will start on October 12-14th. The competition portion of the fellowship will take place over 5 weekends in October and November (see below). Students will develop their apps in our lab setting on weekends: &lt;strong&gt;October 19-21&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;October 26-28&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 2-4&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 9-11&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 16-18&lt;/strong&gt;. Meeting times on weekends will be defined in coordination with fellows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-the-candidate-gain-from-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can the candidate gain from the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, the candidates that are chosen to participate will receive a stipend, a certificate of participation, direct interaction with our state’s decisionmakers and other thought leaders in addition to a real working product that can be included in the candidate&amp;rsquo;s digital portfolio for future references. This is on top of the financial “base reward” of $100 for 8 weeks. This base stipend is independent of the performance of the participants. The final financial reward is allocated based on the participants standing in the cohort (below lowest 25% of the participants, better than the lower 25% quartile but worse than 50% of the participants, better than 50% of the fellows but worse than the upper 25%, in the upper 25% quartile). The top 25% can receive a final payment of $800 dollars. The reward depends on how well the fellows score at each stage of the competition in the area of analytics, information visualization, and novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-during-the-first-phase-of-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens during the first phase of the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will tackle a real-world challenge in the area of workforce analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will prepare and analyze open data as well as ‘restricted’ data that are exclusively available for the fellows through the collaboration with DWD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will advance your skills in HTML, CSS, and D3.js during the training session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will use analytical thinking and creativity when exploring, correlating, and visualizing the data in order to respond to the hacking challenge presented to you at the start of the hacking challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will create and test a web-based app that is novel in terms of data visualization (D3.js) and also interactive features. You will also test your prototype in the lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will participate in and experience experimental lab studies using eye-tracking technologies and data science methods (A/B testing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will interact with a team of experts (professors, researchers, representatives of DWD, team members of the chief data scientists of Indiana).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will have the opportunity to present your final outcomes in a presentation to a board of experts consisting of DWD, other policymakers, and Purdue researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your final study will be published as a short whitepaper including a demonstration of your prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds overwhelming? We will be here to support you: There are tutors, mentors, etc. who will help you in this program to ramp up fast. We will have a training period! There will be also free food on weekends and drinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria-for-selection-of-candidates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for selection of candidates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate will need to present proof of the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrolled in a program requiring programming experience (computer science, computer graphics technology, engineering or related areas) or other evidence for prior programming experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence with interest on learning and having experience in developing web applications using HTML/CSS/Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving skills and the ability and willingness to learn new techniques quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in data visualization and data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally also prior experience with Javascript and D3.js, learning and doing cool stuff!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-next-steps-to-become-part-of-the-fellowship-cohort-for-fall-2018&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the next steps to become part of the fellowship cohort for Fall 2018?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested students will need to submit an application &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcodi.org/fellowship-registration-form/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-rcodi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About RCODI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at Purdue University brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars and thinkers focused on the emerging phenomenon of open digital innovation. Open digital innovation encompasses completely new ways we create and use information and data-driven products and services. We design and evaluate data-driven applications and smart technologies to tackle societal challenges such as sustainability, safety, healthy living. Social coding platforms and virtual hacking communities serve as our virtual living labs. Our researchers use advance techniques of computational social science such as behavioral analytics and large-scale online experiments to develop new digital technologies that support humans in the role as citizens, workers, and policymakers in making smarter decisions. As user-inspired researchers, we intensively engage with industry partners, policymakers, and individual citizens. In 2016, RCODI launched Purdue IronHacks, a unique virtual multi-staged open data competition, in which students and innovators develop novel and useful apps to solve societal challenges. More Information about RCODI: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rcodi.org&#34;&gt;www.rcodi.org&lt;/a&gt; and IronHacks: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ironhacks.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.ironhacks.com&lt;/a&gt;. The program is funded by the Science of Science and Innovation Policy Program (SciSPI) of the National Science Foundation (NSF, Award No. #1462044). Dr. Sabine Brunswicker is the founder and director of RCODI, as well as Associate Professor for Digital Innovation at Purdue University. She also acts as a policy advisor in the USA and Europe and has been a keynote speaker at events like World Economic Forum. no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-fellowship-structured&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the fellowship structured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is collaborating with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to launch a unique data analytics fellowship program focused on the area of &lt;strong&gt;workforce analytics&lt;/strong&gt;. The fellowship is open for a cohort of undergraduate students enrolled at Purdue University (between 30 to 50 students will be admitted) that go through a two-stage program, including undergraduate research, in which they analyze, visualize and interactively display their results in web-based “app” to be used by policymakers for their decisions on workforce development in the state of Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full program is structured in two phases. Phase 1 includes the 8-week program, in which undergraduate students explore open governmental data as well as workforce data available for the selected fellows only (e.g. skill-level, unfilled jobs, training opportunities). They will analyze, visualize the data, and make them actionable in an interactive web “app” using technologies like HTML, CSS, and D3.js (see cool data visualizations done in D3.js in Figure 1 below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure1_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: D3.js visualizations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;https://d3js.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to develop an interactive app that is used by the governmental actors and agencies when making important workforce-related decisions. The first phase is set-up as hacking challenge run by RCODI, in which a cohort of 30 to 50 students go through a structured training and tutorial program, and then participate in 5 iterative hacking events, in which they use their creativity to develop novel and useful workforce apps. Depending on performance in the first 8 weeks, Phase 2 includes the opportunity for a longer-term fellowship follow-on for selected top students to deepen their analysis and advance their project further individually or in a small team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase lasts 8 weeks and is structured in distinct phases visualized in the figure below. It starts with pre-training sessions to familiarize participants with technologies (e.g. APIs, D3.js) needed, followed by a 5-stage iterative on-campus competition. During this training period, you will also be familiarized with the DWD data during sessions run by representatives of the state, and a team of data scientists. Fellows will have access to tutorials, live help sessions, a social coding environment, and community features. Automatic hosting of apps, code evaluations, and workflow support for usability judging provides additional assistance to the hackers in agile design and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rcodi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Figure2_fellowship.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Process for phase 1 of the hacking program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training period will start on October 12-14th. The competition portion of the fellowship will take place over 5 weekends in October and November (see below). Students will develop their apps in our lab setting on weekends: &lt;strong&gt;October 19-21&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;October 26-28&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 2-4&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 9-11&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;November 16-18&lt;/strong&gt;. Meeting times on weekends will be defined in coordination with fellows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-the-candidate-gain-from-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can the candidate gain from the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, the candidates that are chosen to participate will receive a stipend, a certificate of participation, direct interaction with our state’s decisionmakers and other thought leaders in addition to a real working product that can be included in the candidate&amp;rsquo;s digital portfolio for future references. This is on top of the financial “base reward” of $100 for 8 weeks. This base stipend is independent of the performance of the participants. The final financial reward is allocated based on the participants standing in the cohort (below lowest 25% of the participants, better than the lower 25% quartile but worse than 50% of the participants, better than 50% of the fellows but worse than the upper 25%, in the upper 25% quartile). The top 25% can receive a final payment of $800 dollars. The reward depends on how well the fellows score at each stage of the competition in the area of analytics, information visualization, and novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-during-the-first-phase-of-the-fellowship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens during the first phase of the fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will tackle a real-world challenge in the area of workforce analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will prepare and analyze open data as well as ‘restricted’ data that are exclusively available for the fellows through the collaboration with DWD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will advance your skills in HTML, CSS, and D3.js during the training session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will use analytical thinking and creativity when exploring, correlating, and visualizing the data in order to respond to the hacking challenge presented to you at the start of the hacking challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will create and test a web-based app that is novel in terms of data visualization (D3.js) and also interactive features. You will also test your prototype in the lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will participate in and experience experimental lab studies using eye-tracking technologies and data science methods (A/B testing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will interact with a team of experts (professors, researchers, representatives of DWD, team members of the chief data scientists of Indiana).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will have the opportunity to present your final outcomes in a presentation to a board of experts consisting of DWD, other policymakers, and Purdue researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your final study will be published as a short whitepaper including a demonstration of your prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds overwhelming? We will be here to support you: There are tutors, mentors, etc. who will help you in this program to ramp up fast. We will have a training period! There will be also free food on weekends and drinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria-for-selection-of-candidates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for selection of candidates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-rcodi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About RCODI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at Purdue University brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars and thinkers focused on the emerging phenomenon of open digital innovation. Open digital innovation encompasses completely new ways we create and use information and data-driven products and services. We design and evaluate data-driven applications and smart technologies to tackle societal challenges such as sustainability, safety, healthy living. Social coding platforms and virtual hacking communities serve as our virtual living labs. Our researchers use advance techniques of computational social science such as behavioral analytics and large-scale online experiments to develop new digital technologies that support humans in the role as citizens, workers, and policymakers in making smarter decisions. As user-inspired researchers, we intensively engage with industry partners, policymakers, and individual citizens. In 2016, RCODI launched Purdue IronHacks, a unique virtual multi-staged open data competition, in which students and innovators develop novel and useful apps to solve societal challenges. More Information about RCODI: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rcodi.org&#34;&gt;www.rcodi.org&lt;/a&gt; and IronHacks: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ironhacks.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.ironhacks.com&lt;/a&gt;. The program is funded by the Science of Science and Innovation Policy Program (SciSPI) of the National Science Foundation (NSF, Award No. #1462044). Dr. Sabine Brunswicker is the founder and director of RCODI, as well as Associate Professor for Digital Innovation at Purdue University. She also acts as a policy advisor in the USA and Europe and has been a keynote speaker at events like World Economic Forum. no-repeat;center top;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code: TLI 520 [3 credit]
TLI 520 Foundations of Innovation (3 credits) Foundations of Innovation Studies has been designed to provide a broad spectrum introduction to the field of innovation studies. Students will gain practical and theoretical knowledge of innovation at a variety of levels, including the individual, team, organizational, and ecosystem contexts. Students will examine innovation strategies and tensions within the innovation &amp;ldquo;triple helix&amp;rdquo; of industry, academia, and government through the use of case studies and individually selected research reports. Throughout the class, students will examine recent innovation efforts and present short innovation cases that align with the learning objectives of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;digital-innovation-and-transformation&#34;&gt;Digital Innovation and Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code: TLI 526 [3 credit]
Rapidly evolving digital technologies are fueling a stream of innovation opportunities. To remain relevant, incumbent firms need to innovate and transform their business models. Digital strategies and innovation, however, often times conflict with traditional managerial thinking. For example, rapidly falling coordination costs and the rising relevance of data make diversification patterns profitable that contradict today ́s dominant view that focused product-market positioning is best. This course explores the different effects the digital revolution has on the foundations of competitive advantage and thereby prepares its students to design, apply, and implement strategies and systems for digital innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;behavioral-analytics&#34;&gt;Behavioral Analytics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code: TLI 527[3 credit]
Behavioral Analytics has been designed to provide a foundation of skills and tools that enable students to determine their own project topic, collect the data that they need, manipulate that data, and perform analysis consistent with their data. This is an experiential learning process that offers a great deal of flexibility with respect to the methods and tools used, and students are encouraged to create a final project in a manner consistent with publications within their discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;research-in-open-innovation&#34;&gt;Research in Open Innovation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code: TLI 625 [3 credit]
This is a research-oriented course designed for graduate students who aim to develop and implement a scientific research project in the field of open innovation. They will critically discuss and evaluate scientific writings relevant to the new research area of &amp;ldquo;open innovation&amp;rdquo; from the fields and disciplines of innovation studies, information systems, and other social sciences. Through synthesis of theories and frameworks used in academic articles, the students will develop a theoretically and practically motivated research question. They will also implement a pilot study to examine their hypotheses. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) in the Discovery Park at Purdue will offer opportunities to plan and implement individual questions, if students have not identified their own data source. In addition, the students will participate in an action-oriented research project in open innovation performed by the class as a group project to gain experience in experimental innovation research and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-data-hacking&#34;&gt;Open Data Hacking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code: TECH499 [3 credit] This is an experiential class. During this class, you will participate in Purdue IronHacks, a unique iterative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;civic hacking program. You will develop a mashup that integrates several data from data.gov into an interactive web-based application. For more information about Purdue IronHacks please visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ironhacks.com&#34;&gt;www.ironhacks.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;leading-innovation-in-organizations&#34;&gt;Leading Innovation In Organizations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code: TLI314 [3 credit]
This course provides the foundation for understanding the manner in which companies capture innovation and use it to set themselves apart from competitors. Topics covered include the attributes of organizations that are successful in fostering a culture of innovation; the characteristics and roles of leaders and members in innovative organizations; managerial processes and organizational systems that facilitate the successful development, commercialization, and adoption of innovative technologies, products, and services; and methods used to measure innovation-related outcomes. Offered this Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2009, President Obama launched the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Transparent and Open Government&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; initiative in a memorandum, signaling that government should be transparent, participatory, and collaborative. As part of this initiative, Data.gov was launched and now contains over 160,000 datasets, free to the public to use. Thus, the open data definition reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open data is data that anyone can access, use, and share&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://theodi.org/guides/what-open-data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Data Institute&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and THAT&amp;rsquo;S what the Purdue IronHacks are all about: Using open data to create something novel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ironhacks-hacking-for-real-world-impact&#34;&gt;IronHacks: Hacking for real world impact!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To foster the adoption of open governmental data, federal agencies and cities make use of contests and competitive crowds to spur innovation in the hopes of creating applications that create value for the market. However, such contests often fail to tap into the collective knowledge of the hackers crowd, provide little feedback that guides hackers in creating useful applications, and support little re-use of knowledge about useful features, successful algorithms, that can be integrated and remixed in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Fall 2015, The Purdue Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) will launch a new groundbreaking area of research geared towards helping the design of successful idea competitions so that these can more efficiently spur innovation for a higher economic and social welfare at the regional, national, and global scale. With a focus on transparency rather than just participation as a means to foster innovation, The RCODI will run a series of 3-weeks open data hacks, the Purdue &amp;lsquo;IronHacks&amp;rsquo;, that aim to spur civic innovations. The project is focused on the role of transparency as mechanism to spur innovation among that hackers and create open data solutions that are actually used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ironhacks&#34;&gt;The IronHacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In joint collaboration with several Open Data organizations, experts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://purduehackers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Purdue Hackers&lt;/a&gt; and local city councils, and supported by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF), The RCODI will engage over 400 students in 4 IronHacks over 2 years in using open datasets from Data.gov and local governmental datasets from Lafayette and West Lafayette, Indiana. Using these datasets and under the mentorship of skilled technical evangelists the students will combine and recombine various types of data to develop unique and novel solutions that meet performance goals in terms of market demand, technological demand, and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IronHacks represent the true spirit of Purdue: working arduously to solve pressing problems that change the world. With this series of hacks, The RCODI will advance research on how we can better use open data and turn them into novel and useful applications. Furthermore, it will provide guidance for better designing hacks and contests for the generation of novel solutions to pressing issues on a regional, national, and global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-part-of-the-movement&#34;&gt;Be part of the movement!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You love coding, you love getting better at coding, you do not see obstacles but possibilities, and you wish to make a change in society. If you think just one of these criteria fit, you are eligible to compete in the four IronHacks! Joining fellow peers in an inspiring and competitive environment and under the guidance of leading technical experts in Open Data, you will apply theoretical learnings from Purdue and improve on your coding skills in a hectic environment. There will be numerous prizes to be won, including but not limited to: conference presentations of winning projects, field trips to company HQs, paid internships, gadgets, giftcards, money, and much much more. Stay tuned for updates, or if you just cannot wait, shoot us an e-mail - it is never to late to join the movement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;social-perceptions-in-home-energy-graphs&#34;&gt;Social Perceptions in Home Energy Graphs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our information is increasingly data based and our decisions are increasingly guided by data graphs, charts and visualizations. Yet, the dominantly individualist data presentation perspectives utilized in current feedback systems have failed to leverage social behavioral theories to design technologically mediated feedback that could enhance individuals&#39; awareness of and their willingness to cooperate with the digitally interconnected others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ENERGYVIS Project was created to gain deeper insight into how the visual structure of a data graph affects the interpretation and comprehension of the data the chart represents and how they might nudge us to more cooperative choices. Little research has examined the role data visualization design plays in shaping behavior in the context of collective action (e.g., recycling, energy conservation, public protest, juries or organizational committees) that require cooperation and pooling of efforts of individual members, often on a voluntary basis. In such dilemmas, everybody is better off if individuals align with the group goal; however, these tasks typically fail because many do not align with the group&amp;rsquo;s goal. In addition to visual encoding patterns to enhance individuals&#39; social awareness and cooperation, this project will offer resources for new cognitive and perceptual experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-experiments&#34;&gt;Our Experiments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that data based feedback has the potential to make people more aware and cognizant of their synergy decisions. What is lacking is the consideration of the subtle ways in which design details of data based charts frame how people perceive, understand and act in response to the feedback charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We extend visual perception theory by borrowing from group identity literature, which suggests that perceiving a unified group is required for group alignment and continued commitment. So, we hypothesize that seeing and identifying with a perceivably unified group can sustain users&#39; energy conservation efforts. We use social computational methods to study the effects of visual graph structures and motion effects on graph perceptions, interpretations and user actions and consolidate a set of design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;perception-and-interpretation-experiments&#34;&gt;Perception and Interpretation Experiments.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We marry theories of visual perception and group identity to deliver theory driven chart designs that support collective awareness. Our perceptual experiments explore how these visual graph structures increase the perception of group unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;behavioural-game-studies-focused-on-action&#34;&gt;Behavioural Game Studies Focused on Action.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build on existing behavioral game literature and propose a new visualization oriented game framework. We use the behavioral game to explore how the visual graph structures nudge individuals to more cooperative behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation is engaging in the revolution of innovation. We live an open and collaborative innovation landscape in which information and data is widely dispersed, technological systems are opened up, and organizations engage in boundary spanning innovation activities. More decentralized innovation ecosystems have emerged in which a diverse set of actors co-create novel solutions to solve complex problems in areas such healthcare, regional development, financial services, and smart manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might sit down with them, put the controller in their hands, and push buttons with them. You might do the first level with them, and have them copy what you do until they get it down exactly right. They’ll learn pretty quickly - if they have the right aptitude - and they’d be able to teach their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s pretty unlikely that they’ll be better than you by the time you’re done teaching them. If they choose to seek out different teachers - Twitch streamers, that kid at school - then odds are low they’ll get better than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is another approach. It only requires the kid having an unrealistically large amount of time and no real needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just lock them in the room and tell them to leave once they get a perfect score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll start off by trying random things, hoping to stumble across some strategies that yield positive outcomes. Over time, they’ll develop some balance between doing things they know work well and trying new things. Eventually, by the time they get their perfect score, the tactics they use will be entirely original, unsullied by the influence of you or any of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the basis of reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a parent should never lock their kid in a room under such circumstances, having computers play a game millions of times without telling them how to go about it has led to groundbreaking developments. The famous AlphaGo and AlphaZero agents used reinforcement learning to develop the world’s best Go AI and beat top-ranked human player Lee Sedol. Google uses this same technique to manage their data center’s energy consumption. Scientists have been harnessing the power of reinforcement learning to study protein synthesis, advertisement placement, and robots. Reinforcement learning does not learn from humans; as a result, it is free to explore beyond the bounds of our limited creativities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works by having the person define four key components:
The environment
The rewards
The actions
When the game ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the reinforcement learning agent will play the game by itself many, many times (up to billions!) until it has figured out a strategy. What does that strategy look like? Internally, the agent will have figured out an expected value for each state it will encounter based on its experiences. It will then choose the actions that lead to the best future outcomes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At RCODI, my research revolves around using a variant of reinforcement learning - one where multiple agents learn to compete against one another - to model human behavior in the public goods game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collective action game is a social experiment designed to illustrate how people behave in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round, every player is given $10. They can contribute some amount (none, any, or a partial amount) to a group pool or they can pocket some themselves. After the rounds are over, the amount of money in the pool is multiplied by a constant and evenly distributed to each player. The amount of money a player has at the end of the game is the sum of however much they saved and their portion from the group pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everyone could coordinate, then they would all donate $10 each round to make a lot of money. However, it turns out that one would make more money if they convinced everyone else to donate each round but they saved their own money. Moreover, in practice, nobody wants to be the sucker donating everything while others save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, most people will act based on how the others playing the game will act. They will donate a lot if others are contributing a lot, and they will donate little if others are donating a little. This is called conditional cooperation. About 70% of people will play this game in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research involves studying how the information available to the player influences their behavior. I model a conditionally cooperative agent using a rules-based model and two reinforcement learning agents. The rules-based model simulates whether or not the agent should be competitive or cooperative, and then the reinforcement learning agent will take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement learning agent will analyze the given situation and recommend a contribution. The recommendations are based on the reinforcement learning agent having played the collective action game millions and millions of times until it figures out how to maximize its own balance or the group’s (for competitive and cooperative respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are still under way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It marked one and a half year since I got to know Professor Sabine. Today is a special day as I won the battle with my fought with leukemia. When my condition worsened in earlier April, she stepped in quickly to complete the tasks that I was supposed to do. I am forever grateful. Professor Sabine has been the light of my life and a reminder to be positive, motivated and happy in life when I was struggling in between the boundary of life and death. Multiple messages from her asking if I was okay during my procedures, which touched my heart deeply. I would like to dedicate this post to her for her compassion and positive spirit that she has injected into my soul. She is not only a professor, but a lifelong mentor and adviser. This post is written with sincerity and gratefulness by Jay (Student in the School of Engineering, Purdue University)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our very own Master’s Student, Charles Song and his team placed 2nd last weekend in the first “Internet of Things Civic Hackathon” in Fishers, Indiana, run by AT&amp;amp;T and Code for America’s Indiana branch, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openindybrigade.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Indy Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. Using local open data to code mobile apps and hack hardware solutions to help better their community, Charles and his team developed a web application to predict crime in Indianapolis based on 911 dialing records from the Indianapolis Police. Charles was pleased with the outcome and said about the application: “Moving to a new area and picking the best place to live is a monumental decision for anybody and we wanted to make this decision easier for the citizen. Crime can tell you a lot about an area in terms of safety and comfort and this is the first step towards helping future Indianapolis citizens to feel safe in this fantastic city”. Congratulations, Charles and team, for your great effort and 2nd place!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/3408-abe-symposium-at-dlrc-a-great-success/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a lovely Thursday morning and afternoon, Dr. Sabine Brunswicker delivered a plenary speech on the potential for Open Digital Innovation within the agricultural sector for agricultural &amp;amp; biological engineers at the ABE Graduate Symposium. Talking about the potential for platforms such as MyJohnDeere.com and OpenAg.io to bring together various forms of agricultural open data to create more efficient agriculture, interest was high among the participants. We thank the ABE Graduate Student Association for putting together a great event and look forward to the bright future of data-driven agriculture. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7407.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7407-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_7407&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7399.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7399-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_7399&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7387.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_7387-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_7387&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Takeshi is a second year Master’s student in the Graduate School of Business &amp;amp; Commerce, Keio University, Japan. His research  focuses on relations between open innovation and organizational features (e.g. organizational culture, organizational capabilities or organizational structures). &lt;em&gt;” Right now, I’m researching about contributing factors in Japanese organizations when adopting technologies outside with conventional organizational theories”&lt;/em&gt;, Takeshi says. The visit will be for a week this year, but he plans to come back for one of the prime open innovation hubs in the US: &lt;em&gt;“I’m planning to stay at the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation in 2017 with help by the Keio Program for Leading Graduate School (PLGS) and I am very excited for this opportunity”&lt;/em&gt;, Takeshi says. We at RCODI will be looking forward to having him on our team in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With many engaged and motivated developers from Purdue University, the Blue IronHacks awards ceremony came to a great conclusion! With a problem that challenged the students to create a mashup that could help West Lafayette citizens in choosing optimal housing based on a number of criteria, the competition was tough but we witnessed a lot of great solutions. Those that really stood out won great prizes in the form of Amazon giftcards and lots of Socrata and RedHat swag! The winners are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best Solution: Qing Wei&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greatest Improvement and Winning Spirit: En-Hsin Peng&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greatest Community Spirit: Gaoping Huang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winners-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; Winners were greeted by Chris Metcalf, Director of Developer Experience at Socrata, to whom the winners will be presenting their mashups in order to compete for an internship at Socrata. You can watch the video from Chris &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKfbrl8FGbE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. With such great solutions, we look forward to seeing more of the same from our Boilermakers out there whose hearts beat for developing useful applications for the general public good. Look out for upcoming IronHacks next semester and good luck on finals! -Team IronHack&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of motivated hackers finished their second out of three submissions last night at Midnight for the Blue IronHacks and are now up for judging by our expert panel. “The submissions so far have taken into account various problem aspects and settings, and it is truly impressive what the hackers are doing with Open Data”, said Cheryl Hsiang, one of our researchers and judges. Judging will take place over the next three days, before kicking off the final hacking phase on Thursday, November 11, and submitting the final solution Monday, November 23.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DISCOVERY LECTURE SERIES TALK ON INNOVATION DISRUPTION</title>

      <guid>/post/3508-discovery-lecture-series-talk-on-innovation-disruption/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well-known and renowned business strategist, speaker, and author, Paul Nunes, will give a talk for the Discovery Lecture Series &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Big-Bang-Disruption-Devastating-Innovation/dp/1591846900/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1443618684&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=paul&amp;#43;nunes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“Big Bang Disruption: Strategy in the Age of Devastating Innovation”&lt;/a&gt;. Nunes is the Global Managing Director of the Accenture &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accenture.com/us-en/institute-for-high-performance.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for High Performance&lt;/a&gt;, a global “think-and-act-tank” which aims to define and measure high-performance businesses. In his talk, Nunes will discuss the drivers of disruptive innovation in the global marketplace and how these lead to changes in strategy for businesses due to new forms of product lifecycles – innovation is simply more disruptive and happens faster than ever , and companies must learn to think differently. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is co-sponsoring this event, which is part of  a larger effort to build on Purdue’s strengths in computational systems, modeling, technology, engineering, the sciences and entrepreneurship in order to advance research and offer a research-based interdisciplinary graduate education in innovation. The talk will take place at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 7th in Discovery Park’s Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Room 121. &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Sabine Brunswicker, 765-494-0880, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sbrunswi@purdue.edu&#34;&gt;sbrunswi@purdue.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sabine Brunswicker of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation will be chairing a special session focused on the topic of “Open Strategizing in R&amp;amp;D” as a brief description of what will be discussed at the special session please see below: In recent years there has been an increasing interest in “open strategy” among academics and practitioners. The term “open strategy” suggests that openness does not only relate to managing openness in an individual R&amp;amp;D project or in the idea-to-launch process. Open strategizing implies a more open approach towards managing the strategy and policy processes. Open strategy as a process is emerging in private firms which open up their corporate R&amp;amp;D strategy processes. In addition, public organizations emphasize openness when developing strategies and policies. Openness in strategy processes may appear in many different forms, such as the integration of a large number of internal employees. In addition, there are open strategy processes where organizations engage with external stakeholders to co-create novel strategic ideas for emerging strategic areas. In some cases, open strategy making is more concerned with communication to the public. Participatory strategy processes regularly making use of IT (e.g. crowdsourcing platforms) which affords novel ways to engage a large number of participants. There are two key dimensions that characterize open strategy making, namely (1) greater internal and external transparency as well as (2) greater inclusiveness of various actors in strategy-making, internal and external. Greater openness on these dimensions is clearly opposed to conventional notions of strategy which treat it as exclusive and secretive rather than inclusive and transparent. Information systems may both afford or constrain openness in strategy processes.

      <title>NEW PAPER ON OPEN INNOVATION IN SMES</title>
      <link>/post/3474-new-paper-on-open-innovation-in-smes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 00:00:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/3474-new-paper-on-open-innovation-in-smes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sabine Brunswicker and Wim Vanhaverbeke recently authored a paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Small Business Management&lt;/em&gt; on external knowledge sourcing, a form of inbound open innovation in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Earlier work on SMEs indicates that by nature, innovation in such firms has an external focus and is often strongly embedded in social and personal ties. However, the literature also has many gaps. This paper discusses how SMEs purposively source external knowledge in innovation as well as the role of integrative managerial practices for innovation in external knowledge sourcing. &lt;a href=&#34;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2351047&#34; title=&#34;Abstract/Download&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Read more at SSRN »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NEW REPORT EXAMINES HOW LARGE COMPANIES PRACTICE OPEN INNOVATION</title>
      <link>/post/3468-new-report-examines-how-large-companies-practice-open-innovation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2013 00:00:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/3468-new-report-examines-how-large-companies-practice-open-innovation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sabine Brunswicker and Henry Chesbrough have conducted the first large-sample survey of open innovation adoption among large companies. Their study of European and U.S. companies gives an extensive overview of the ways that companies are now practicing open innovation, along with the trends that can be discerned. The results show that large companies consider open innovation to be very important and are expecting it to grow even further. The biggest challenge, however, lies within the organization: managing the journey from closed to open innovation by setting up new structures, processes and responsibilities. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en/business-areas/technology-innovation-management/1060-open-innovation-a-fad-or-a-phenomenon.html&#34; title=&#34;Read More&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Read more at Fraunhofer »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2010 22:24:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/transparency-in-open-data-contest/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study measures the degree of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; to determine the effect of transparency on participation and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transparency-in-open-data-contest&#34;&gt;Transparency in Open Data Contest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Research Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the effects of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and solution &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; on participation and innovativeness of Open Data solutions in Open Data contests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does transparency in open data contests affect civic participation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does transparency influence the novelty, usefulness, and popularity of open data solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in the way agencies and citizens evaluate the innovativeness of these solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of &amp;lsquo;first-of-its-kind&amp;rsquo; 3 weeks fully virtual hacks known as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.purdue.edu/opendigital/purdue-ironhacks/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Purdue IronHacks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, we explore &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;participation&lt;/em&gt; in Open Data (OD) solutions in OD contests. The OD project introduces the concept of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; in OD contests. We draw upon the theory of private-collective innovation, self-organizing governance and our previous research in organizing innovation contests, collective action, and open public policy and problem solving. The goal of this project is to provide a new perspective on how to promote impact from governmental OD. Using machine readable open datasets from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.data.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data.gov&lt;/a&gt; focusing on the areas of: Health, Energy, Climate, Education, Finance, Public Safety, and Global Development, we conduct an empirical quantitative study to explain the effect of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; on governmental OD impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a data driven and computational research approach, in a series of quasi-experimental OD contests, several hundred citizens, developers, and students will participate in a ‘virtual’ lab environment. Non-expert citizens and developers will collaborate to identify problems, share different perspectives, critical decisions, and seek solutions. The degree of &lt;em&gt;innovation performance transparency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solution transparency&lt;/em&gt; will be measured in order to determine the effect of transparency on participation and innovation. Findings from these experiments will be implemented in larger national OD contests, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackforchange.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. In sum, this study will provide evidence-based guidelines for the design of OD contests and how to utilize transparency and knowledge sharing to increase the impact of governmental OD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration: 24 months&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Home Energy Monitoring, Visual Analytics and Collective-Action</title>
      <link>/project/home-energy-monitoring-visual-analytics-and-collective-action/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2010 22:24:06 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project extracts granular perceptual, behavioral and interaction data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;graph-based-feedback-for-collaborative-energy-consumption&#34;&gt;Graph Based Feedback for Collaborative Energy Consumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data-driven feedback and interactions with personal devices are changing the way we make decisions. They increasingly use visual interactive graphs (e.g. bar charts) that allow us to explore variability in our own behaviors and those of others. They aim to motivate behavioral change, for example through greater self-awareness and review of personal progress. However, today’s visual graphs often fail to facilitate the fundamental tasks of collective action, such as preserving the environment and saving energy. Yet, cooperation is needed to overcome problems of social loafing and our tendency to act selfishly. This project explores how visual data-driven graphs may lead to sustained cooperative behavior if they frame our choices from a group’s perspective. A graph’s content, its data and metrics, but also the way this content is visually presented may elicit cooperative behavior. The goal is to develop a visual graph theory that articulates how fundamental visual graph features lead to collective-oriented perceptions and actions through a unifying visual graph grammar. To do so, we conduct a series of controlled perceptual experiments using human computational methods and public good games, in which individuals interact with visual graphs. The goal is to move beyond design heuristics and furnish causal relationships between visual graph features and perceptions. This project will extract granular perceptual, behavioral and interaction data using new data collection techniques, empirical and experimental studies, and will create tangible artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New human-centric visual graph grammar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New graph grammar encoded in actual software code, for the context of collective action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Causal relationships between visual graph feature on perceived unity and cooperative behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using controlled experiments we overcome the limitation of design heuristics in guiding graph design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results will contribute to fields of &lt;em&gt;data visualization&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Human Computer Interaction (HCI)&lt;/em&gt;, but also to the work on &lt;em&gt;collective action&lt;/em&gt; that still ignores the role of graph-based interaction using digital devices.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./OSS-graph.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study aims to understand how Open Source Software practices are evolving by focusing on studying a prominent community &amp;lsquo;OpenStack&amp;rsquo; that is effectively using the latest practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modeling-complex-open-source-software-structures-as-networks&#34;&gt;Modeling Complex Open Source Software Structures as Networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the commitment to foster and build Open Source Software practices, Red Hat Inc. sponsors a two-year Red Hat fellowship for Discovery Park&amp;rsquo;s Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Inc. provided a 100,000$ gift to Purdue to advance in this field led by technology and innovation professor Sabine Brunswicker. The objective of Red Hat funding this fellowship is to establish itself as a &amp;ldquo;significant catalyst of open-digital innovation ecosystems and communities research intended to answer questions critical to the sustainable impact of open standards and open-source and novel open forms of innovation and production in a broader sense,&amp;rdquo; Brunswicker said. Open Source Software is lately gaining traction in fields that traditionally were considered to be close as telecommunication, health care, or even banking. Therefore, this fellowship is divided in two different stages. The first stage is to understand how Open Source Software practices are evolving by focusing on studying a prominent community &amp;lsquo;OpenStack&amp;rsquo; that is effectively using the latest practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is a set of software tools for managing and building public and private cloud computing platform. The second stage is researching how these practices can be applied to other fields as telecommunications. Through the fellowship research on architecture, governance and behaviors of heterogeneous open-innovation communities as OpenStack will be examined. Research results will be shared with Red Hat as part of a collaborative dialogue between these two groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Global Open Innovation Executive Study 2014/2015</title>
      <link>/project/2014-2015-global-open-innovation-executive-study/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open innovation is growing into a mainstream phenomenon of increasing business relevance in large firms where 78 percent of large firms in the sample had been applying open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;global-open-innovation-executive-study&#34;&gt;Global Open Innovation Executive Study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, a large-scale Open Innovation Executive Survey was conducted by UC- Berkeley and Fraunhofer-Society to explore to what extent open innovation was applied in large firms in the USA and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results show, open innovation is growing into a mainstream phenomenon of increasing business relevance in large firms where 78 percent of large firms in the sample had been applying open innovation, although they were in the early stage of practicing and understanding open innovation. To access the survey report, please click &lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/wC6qRT&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building upon these results, there is a need to advance our understanding of adoption of open innovation at project level. Existing academic literature and theories on open innovation have regularly focused on firm-level aggregates to understand the role of open innovation in firm performance; they have not provided sufficient insights into the adoption of open innovation at a project level. The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) at the Purdue University and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://corporateinnovation.berkeley.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Garwood Center for Corporate Innovation&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California-Berkeley in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fraunhofer-Society&lt;/a&gt; want to address this gap by conducting this research. We implemented the second Open Innovation Executive Survey in order to deepen our understanding of adoption of open innovation not only at firm-level but also at project level. In a nutshell, in this research project, we aim to implement a quantitative survey study on open innovation among senior executives in large firms in the USA, Europe and Japan with the main focus on different open innovation practices, new practices, ways to deal with managing and sharing know-how and IP, and new ways to measure open innovation performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration: 22 months (3/2014-1/2016)&lt;/p&gt;

This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-open-innovation-with-business-impact-in-the-digital-age&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Open Innovation with Business Impact in the Digital Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Accenture Institute for High Performance (AIHP), we have implemented a series of open innovation (OI) case studies to generate new insights on how large, innovative firms use open innovation to solve their strategic innovation problems. One particular example concluded in 2017 is that of Samsung, and its endeavor to seek IoT prototypes created by communities participating in an open innovatoin challenge. Read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000__w__/gb-en/_acnmedia/pdf-43/accenture-open-innovation-at-samsung.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Brunswicker and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increased digital transformation of many sectors, such problems are increasingly difficult to address. Our preliminary research suggests that one of the keys to running a successful open innovation program is choosing the correct operational mode of open innovation for the business problem at hand. This requires evaluating problem complexity and knowledge uncertainty associated with a business problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of companies who have chosen to integrate open innovation have realized that there are specific management practices required to effectively execute open innovation. Open innovation problems can involve a high level of uncertainty and technological complexity and require firms to move from traditional modes of collaboration (such as alliances) towards more open interactions with deeper exchanges of know-how and greater ambiguity such as crowds and communities. There are management challenges specific to open innovation that require a unique set of strategies and processes to be in place in order to overcome these challenges and be able to achieve higher business value through open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation by selecting the appropriate open innovation model, and integrating successful management strategies to balance the tensions of knowledge sharing and protection in the midst of strategic and operational ambiguity. This framework will also equip open innovation leaders with new insights into successful practices for creating business impact from open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing Future Megacities with the Crowd: Wicked Urban Problems and Firm-sponsored Civic Innovation Crowdsourcing 2015</title>
      <link>/project/2015-designing-future-megacities-with-crowdsourcing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project presents a successful civic innovation crowdsourcing project case study to co-create visionary solutions to the challenge of future mobility in crowded cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;designing-future-megacities-with-the-crowd-wicked-urban-problems-and-firm-sponsored-civic-innovation-crowdsourcing-2015&#34;&gt;Designing Future Megacities with the Crowd: Wicked Urban Problems and Firm-sponsored Civic Innovation Crowdsourcing 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of megacities, urban innovators are exposed to increasingly ‘wicked’ societal problems, such as urban mobility. Looking beyond traditional modes for solving these problems, this research sheds light on civic innovation crowdsourcing; a new open model of innovation for solving societal problems in the public and government sector. Through a unique case study, a civic innovation contest sponsored by Bombardier was examined using content analysis. Civic innovation crowdsourcing and how team submissions and geographic contextualization shape the problem solving process was examined in three major cities, Belo Horizonte, Vientiane, and London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that: 1.: Civic Innovation Crowdsourcing creates a diverse set of comprehensive solutions and highlights key complexity attributes from a citizen’s perspective, 2: crowd members tackle complexity at the level of each problem dimension and collectively highlight critical attributes and novel solutions, 3.: Civic Innovation Crowdsourcing furnishes an alternative mode of urban problem solving and affords addressing complexity breadth, and 4.: team and individual submissions differ in the way they address complexity, with teams addressing more attributes of a problem than individuals. This case suggests that designing with the crowd may overcome a central ‘tragedy’ of urban Mobility: While mobility is a greater good that is fundamental for cities to flourish, it puts other public good at risk. Thus, only jointly with the citizens, can businesses, city councils, and NGOs design future mobile urban ecosystems that will ‘evolve’ towards greater economic, social, and ecological performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;increasing-creativity-through-anonymous-dissent-2015&#34;&gt;Increasing Creativity through Anonymous Dissent 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees within an organization are often encouraged to contribute to internal Open Innovation Challenges, however, the creativity of their contributions may be limited by their perceived freedom to express ideas and opinions that are against majority opinions or organizational norms. Troublesome ideas and opinions may impact their work reputation, standing within the organization, and even their future employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to make all contributions to internal Open Innovation Challenges anonymous, however, that would reduce the social and reputational rewards associated with participation and co-creation of solutions. Working in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brightidea.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bright Idea&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Open Innovation Platform provider, we are testing the impact of selective anonymity, where participants can flag their contributions to be displayed anonymously. Using selective anonymity, participants can enjoy all the usual reputational and social rewards that are accrued while participating in an Open Innovation Challenge, while simultaneously offering risk-free minority dissent, which is necessary to increase the diversity of opinions and inspire creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are Partnering with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Landcare Research&lt;/a&gt;, one of seven Crown Research organizations in New Zealand,  to test the effects of selective anonymity on participant contributions. Utilizing a strategic planning question that is of pressing importance to the organization, we will assist Landcare Research by running an internal Open Innovation Challenge on the Bright Idea platform, which includes the opportunity for selective anonymity, and instructions to guide participants in the importance of anonymous contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Governance  and Risk-mitigation of Open Innovation</title>
      <link>/project/governance-and-risk-mitigation-of-open-innovation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2010 22:24:06 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project tests a moderated mediation model in which external search breadth and depth influence open innovation project performance through their effects by different governance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;governance-and-risk-mitigation-of-open-innovation&#34;&gt;Governance and Risk-mitigation of Open Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Henry Chesbrough’s (2003) landmark work on open innovation, much attention has been given to the phenomenon of firms’ using a wide range of external actors and sources to help them achieve and sustain innovation (Laursen and Salter, 2006). Prior studies have highlighted the positive influences of open innovation activities on innovation outcomes in large firms (Parida et al., 2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, few studies have investigated the key governance mechanism of open innovation and their interaction to induce higher level of innovation performance in specific collaborative open innovation projects. We simultaneously examine the influence of external search breadth and depth in open innovation partners’ interactions on project performance. We contend that: (a) these two dimensions influence open innovation project performance through different governance mechanisms (process control, outcome control); and (b) the project’s related innovation complexity alters the effect of external search breadth and depth on open innovation project performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We develop and test a moderated mediation model in which external search breadth and depth influence open innovation project performance through their effects by different governance mechanisms, and these indirect effects are moderated by different levels of innovation complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied structural equation modelling (SEM) using the MPlus 7.31 (Muthén &amp;amp; Muthén, 2015) to test for the hypothesized relationships among the constructs: external search breadth and depth, process control, outcome control, innovation complexity and open innovation project performance, as well as for the interaction effects of process control, outcome control and innovation complexity on open innovation project performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;**:**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of a moderated mediation model where the project performance is moderated by the different levels of innovation complexity.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Digital practice networks, network dynamics and e-science</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research is aimed at comparing the network effects formed in online digital platforms of participating scientists to “traditional” research and collaboration methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;effect-of-online-digital-communities-to-members-output-success-and-choices-contagion-the-case-nanohub-cyberinfrastructure&#34;&gt;Effect of Online Digital Communities to Members Output (Success) and Choices (Contagion): The Case NanoHUB Cyberinfrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary research questions that sparked this project were: (1) How does scientist output depend upon their embeddedness in digital spaces in NanoHUB.org cyerinfrastructure?; (2) What are the network formation structures and characteristics of an open digital platform?; (3) How do tools traverse (diffuse) amongst users in NanoHUB.org cyberinfrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the NanoHUB.org cyberinfrastructure analyzed using network science, spatial econometics, and network social modelling techniques, this research is aimed at comparing the network effects formed in online digital platforms of participating scientists to “traditional” research and collaboration methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation, mechanism, and process of networks that influence scientists output in digital platforms, like with NanoHUB.org, is limited and contradictory. According to Klimeck et al and nanoHUB.org,  nanoHub.org is a novel science and engineering ecosystem comprised of self-organized researchers, educators, and professionals in eight member institutions that collaborate, share resources, and solve nanotechnology related problems. Results of this project identify the organizational and structural effects of digital platforms to members’ developmental success in addition to diffusion of tools in user community. Also, the network social modelling reveals the network formation patterns and characteristics of online digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration: 2014 to 2016&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project aims to identify how new ways of constructing exchange are emerging in society&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchain-networks-and-transparency&#34;&gt;Blockchain Networks and Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From an interdisciplinary perspective, the research aim is to explore and develop the interlinkage between network science and blockchain technology. One question is how network science can be used to study the blockchain industry and vice versa. This means applying network science concepts and methods to the study and experimental investigation of the blockchain industry. This also includes using blockchain as a technology platform to study the network behavior of the blockchain industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From an economic perspective, the research aim is to identify how new ways of constructing exchange are emerging in society. The hypothesis to test is that blockchain technology allows a new form of peer-to-peer service provision and exchange between parties, which leads to new conceptualizations, sensibilities, and practices regarding exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a social perspective, the research program seeks to quantify the amount of intangible social goods produced by the blockchain economy such as freedom, autonomy, dignity, choice, and trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigators: Melanie Swan, Dr. Sabine Brunswicker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74989091/114110737-34a2a700-98a6-11eb-8932-e84b84571cd0.png&#34; alt=&#34;featured&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ironhacks&#34;&gt;IronHacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is an open data hacking program that empowers programmers - from beginners to professionals - to solve civic challenges during a multi-phase and learning-oriented process.  The IronHacks platform offers participants a no-set-up programming environment and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations that help citizens and governments to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-challenges&#34;&gt;Example challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;covid-19-data-science-challenge&#34;&gt;COVID-19 Data Science Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use data provided by suppliers such as SafeGraph to predict areas that will be impacted by  COVID-19 based on foot traffic.
What are the Challenges about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our COVID-19 Data Science Challenges invite participants to build statistical models and visualizations that monitor and predict social movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic over time. The goal is to predict weekly patterns of movement and social interaction in our local communities to understand COVID-19 risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: This first COVID-19 Data Science Challenge focuses on predicting the foot traffic at major brands (e.g. Target, Domino&amp;rsquo;s Pizza etc.). The goal is to foresee which brands are experiencing the greatest surge in visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: Protect Purdue. This challenge asks participants to monitor and predict weekly foot traffic at thousands of places of interests (e.g. restaurants, stores, churches) in the Greater West-Lafayette. It responds to a statement made by Purdue&amp;rsquo;s Leadership team: that COVID-19 risk is not necessarily arising in campus buildings but, rather, emerging from off-campus social gatherings like in restaurants, shops, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants have access to BIG actual, granular and temporal data they typically do not have access to: Data about social distancing behavior, foot traffic, COVID-19 incidents, as well as executive orders. This data is also used by state governments in the US as well scientists who try to understand social movements during COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with this data, participants will work in the IronHacks workspace with JupyterLab and access to BigQuery to create novel and useful statistical models and visualizations using Python and R. Participants will submit Jupyter notebooks and their outputs (html and markdown files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;affordable-housing&#34;&gt;AFFORDABLE HOUSING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./topics-housing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a website with interactive visualizations that helps new students in finding safe and affordable housing near their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workforce-analytics&#34;&gt;WORKFORCE ANALYTICS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./14_1-2X1-e1522941729110.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use workforce data to explore factors that affect successful career paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-process-work&#34;&gt;How does the process work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IronHacks is a global virtual open data hacking platform that allows users to participate in a high-energy IronHacks competition. The IronHacks platform offers participants a no setup workspace with JupyterLab and BigQueryintegration and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations. It also offers training and tutorials, as well as a personal dashboard to view scores and progress through the competition. After registration, participants can warm-up, practice their skills and query sample data until sufficient participants have joined to launch the competition. After the start of the competition, a multiphase process will start. Each challenge moves through the following phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-submission-there-will-be-a-final-submission-before-we-identify-the-winners&#34;&gt;Registration and warm-up phase: If you have registered for one of the Challenges that are available, you will have the opportunity to warm-up using our tutorials.
Start of competition followed by multiphase process: The competition starts based on invitation, usually followed by multiple interim and one final submission Interim submissions: At multiple interim submission points, you will receive immediate feedback on your current standing, giving you the opportunity to improve over time.
Final submission: There will be a final submission before we identify the winners.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-impact&#34;&gt;Our Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific team at Purdue generated new knowledge and technologies on the implications of machine-enabled feedback and transparency on participant&amp;rsquo;s productivity and innovation performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, thousands of participants have hacked in parallel virtually around the globe gaining valuable experience in coding as well as work for the chance to win internships, Amazon gift cards, cool swag, and certificates. In addition to the students participation and learning, IronHacks provide the opportunity to do research on open innovation contest processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants developed novel and useful open data solutions in an interactive environment. The platform&amp;rsquo;s features helped them continuously improve their submissions while learning from real-time feedback and others participating in the hack. A new virtual movement of hacking has emerged at Purdue and beyond. Participants come from the U.S., Colombia, and China. Virtual setting encourages a more diverse audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rapid&#34;&gt;RAPID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a collaborative project where RCODI works alongside Software Factory Labs (SFL) to conduct research concerning engagement and performance of R&amp;amp;D contacts. With government contracting, there are types of parties that are consistently applying and winning contracts. DARPA solicited the general public for a means to address the segmented competition within contracts, with the hopes of engaging more small businesses, opening the narrowly-perceived corridor for defense contract innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCODI and SFL are currently exploring the reasons behind such a limited workforce with the hopes of enabling more small business participation within government contracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration is currently on-going.&lt;/p&gt;
