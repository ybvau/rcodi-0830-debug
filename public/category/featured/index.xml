      <title>Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-would-you-teach-a-child-to-play-a-video-game&#34;&gt;How would you teach a child to play a video game?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might sit down with them, put the controller in their hands, and push buttons with them. You might do the first level with them, and have them copy what you do until they get it down exactly right. They’ll learn pretty quickly - if they have the right aptitude - and they’d be able to teach their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s pretty unlikely that they’ll be better than you by the time you’re done teaching them. If they choose to seek out different teachers - Twitch streamers, that kid at school - then odds are low they’ll get better than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is another approach. It only requires the kid having an unrealistically large amount of time and no real needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just lock them in the room and tell them to leave once they get a perfect score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll start off by trying random things, hoping to stumble across some strategies that yield positive outcomes. Over time, they’ll develop some balance between doing things they know work well and trying new things. Eventually, by the time they get their perfect score, the tactics they use will be entirely original, unsullied by the influence of you or any of their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the basis of reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a parent should never lock their kid in a room under such circumstances, having computers play a game millions of times without telling them how to go about it has led to groundbreaking developments. The famous AlphaGo and AlphaZero agents used reinforcement learning to develop the world’s best Go AI and beat top-ranked human player Lee Sedol. Google uses this same technique to manage their data center’s energy consumption. Scientists have been harnessing the power of reinforcement learning to study protein synthesis, advertisement placement, and robots. Reinforcement learning does not learn from humans; as a result, it is free to explore beyond the bounds of our limited creativities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works by having the person define four key components:
The environment
The rewards
The actions
When the game ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the reinforcement learning agent will play the game by itself many, many times (up to billions!) until it has figured out a strategy. What does that strategy look like? Internally, the agent will have figured out an expected value for each state it will encounter based on its experiences. It will then choose the actions that lead to the best future outcomes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At RCODI, my research revolves around using a variant of reinforcement learning - one where multiple agents learn to compete against one another - to model human behavior in the public goods game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collective action game is a social experiment designed to illustrate how people behave in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each round, every player is given $10. They can contribute some amount (none, any, or a partial amount) to a group pool or they can pocket some themselves. After the rounds are over, the amount of money in the pool is multiplied by a constant and evenly distributed to each player. The amount of money a player has at the end of the game is the sum of however much they saved and their portion from the group pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everyone could coordinate, then they would all donate $10 each round to make a lot of money. However, it turns out that one would make more money if they convinced everyone else to donate each round but they saved their own money. Moreover, in practice, nobody wants to be the sucker donating everything while others save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, most people will act based on how the others playing the game will act. They will donate a lot if others are contributing a lot, and they will donate little if others are donating a little. This is called conditional cooperation. About 70% of people will play this game in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research involves studying how the information available to the player influences their behavior. I model a conditionally cooperative agent using a rules-based model and two reinforcement learning agents. The rules-based model simulates whether or not the agent should be competitive or cooperative, and then the reinforcement learning agent will take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement learning agent will analyze the given situation and recommend a contribution. The recommendations are based on the reinforcement learning agent having played the collective action game millions and millions of times until it figures out how to maximize its own balance or the group’s (for competitive and cooperative respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are still under way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing Open Innovation with Business Impact in the Digital Age</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./acc-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;featured&#34;&gt;
This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-open-innovation-with-business-impact-in-the-digital-age&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Open Innovation with Business Impact in the Digital Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Accenture Institute for High Performance (AIHP), we have implemented a series of open innovation (OI) case studies to generate new insights on how large, innovative firms use open innovation to solve their strategic innovation problems. One particular example concluded in 2017 is that of Samsung, and its endeavor to seek IoT prototypes created by communities participating in an open innovatoin challenge. Read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000__w__/gb-en/_acnmedia/pdf-43/accenture-open-innovation-at-samsung.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Brunswicker and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increased digital transformation of many sectors, such problems are increasingly difficult to address. Our preliminary research suggests that one of the keys to running a successful open innovation program is choosing the correct operational mode of open innovation for the business problem at hand. This requires evaluating problem complexity and knowledge uncertainty associated with a business problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of companies who have chosen to integrate open innovation have realized that there are specific management practices required to effectively execute open innovation. Open innovation problems can involve a high level of uncertainty and technological complexity and require firms to move from traditional modes of collaboration (such as alliances) towards more open interactions with deeper exchanges of know-how and greater ambiguity such as crowds and communities. There are management challenges specific to open innovation that require a unique set of strategies and processes to be in place in order to overcome these challenges and be able to achieve higher business value through open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aims to create a guided open innovation framework to help companies leverage optimal value from open innovation by selecting the appropriate open innovation model, and integrating successful management strategies to balance the tensions of knowledge sharing and protection in the midst of strategic and operational ambiguity. This framework will also equip open innovation leaders with new insights into successful practices for creating business impact from open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74989091/114110737-34a2a700-98a6-11eb-8932-e84b84571cd0.png&#34; alt=&#34;featured&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ironhacks&#34;&gt;IronHacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is an open data hacking program that empowers programmers - from beginners to professionals - to solve civic challenges during a multi-phase and learning-oriented process.  The IronHacks platform offers participants a no-set-up programming environment and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations that help citizens and governments to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-challenges&#34;&gt;Example challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;covid-19-data-science-challenge&#34;&gt;COVID-19 Data Science Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use data provided by suppliers such as SafeGraph to predict areas that will be impacted by  COVID-19 based on foot traffic.
What are the Challenges about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our COVID-19 Data Science Challenges invite participants to build statistical models and visualizations that monitor and predict social movement behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic over time. The goal is to predict weekly patterns of movement and social interaction in our local communities to understand COVID-19 risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: This first COVID-19 Data Science Challenge focuses on predicting the foot traffic at major brands (e.g. Target, Domino&amp;rsquo;s Pizza etc.). The goal is to foresee which brands are experiencing the greatest surge in visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall 2020 COVID-19 Data Science Challenge: Protect Purdue. This challenge asks participants to monitor and predict weekly foot traffic at thousands of places of interests (e.g. restaurants, stores, churches) in the Greater West-Lafayette. It responds to a statement made by Purdue&amp;rsquo;s Leadership team: that COVID-19 risk is not necessarily arising in campus buildings but, rather, emerging from off-campus social gatherings like in restaurants, shops, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants have access to BIG actual, granular and temporal data they typically do not have access to: Data about social distancing behavior, foot traffic, COVID-19 incidents, as well as executive orders. This data is also used by state governments in the US as well scientists who try to understand social movements during COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipped with this data, participants will work in the IronHacks workspace with JupyterLab and access to BigQuery to create novel and useful statistical models and visualizations using Python and R. Participants will submit Jupyter notebooks and their outputs (html and markdown files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;affordable-housing&#34;&gt;AFFORDABLE HOUSING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./topics-housing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a website with interactive visualizations that helps new students in finding safe and affordable housing near their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workforce-analytics&#34;&gt;WORKFORCE ANALYTICS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./14_1-2X1-e1522941729110.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use workforce data to explore factors that affect successful career paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-process-work&#34;&gt;How does the process work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IronHacks is a global virtual open data hacking platform that allows users to participate in a high-energy IronHacks competition. The IronHacks platform offers participants a no setup workspace with JupyterLab and BigQueryintegration and many powerful features to create novel and useful models and visualizations. It also offers training and tutorials, as well as a personal dashboard to view scores and progress through the competition. After registration, participants can warm-up, practice their skills and query sample data until sufficient participants have joined to launch the competition. After the start of the competition, a multiphase process will start. Each challenge moves through the following phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-submission-there-will-be-a-final-submission-before-we-identify-the-winners&#34;&gt;Registration and warm-up phase: If you have registered for one of the Challenges that are available, you will have the opportunity to warm-up using our tutorials.
Start of competition followed by multiphase process: The competition starts based on invitation, usually followed by multiple interim and one final submission Interim submissions: At multiple interim submission points, you will receive immediate feedback on your current standing, giving you the opportunity to improve over time.
Final submission: There will be a final submission before we identify the winners.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-impact&#34;&gt;Our Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific team at Purdue generated new knowledge and technologies on the implications of machine-enabled feedback and transparency on participant&amp;rsquo;s productivity and innovation performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, thousands of participants have hacked in parallel virtually around the globe gaining valuable experience in coding as well as work for the chance to win internships, Amazon gift cards, cool swag, and certificates. In addition to the students participation and learning, IronHacks provide the opportunity to do research on open innovation contest processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants developed novel and useful open data solutions in an interactive environment. The platform&amp;rsquo;s features helped them continuously improve their submissions while learning from real-time feedback and others participating in the hack. A new virtual movement of hacking has emerged at Purdue and beyond. Participants come from the U.S., Colombia, and China. Virtual setting encourages a more diverse audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;rapid&#34;&gt;RAPID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a collaborative project where RCODI works alongside Software Factory Labs (SFL) to conduct research concerning engagement and performance of R&amp;amp;D contacts. With government contracting, there are types of parties that are consistently applying and winning contracts. DARPA solicited the general public for a means to address the segmented competition within contracts, with the hopes of engaging more small businesses, opening the narrowly-perceived corridor for defense contract innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCODI and SFL are currently exploring the reasons behind such a limited workforce with the hopes of enabling more small business participation within government contracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration is currently on-going.&lt;/p&gt;
